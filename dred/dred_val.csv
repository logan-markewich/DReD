"In conclusion , we have shown the tunable quantum tunneling in the V-doped WSe 2 / SnSe 2 heterostructure by varying the doping concentration at room temperature . A liquid precursor containing transition metal and vanadium dopant atoms is used in our approach to synthesize - WSe 2 via CVD . The precise control of the doping concentration efficiently modulates the Fermi level position , achieving the p-type doping effect . This method induces the substitution of by , endowing a proper band bending for the desired band alignment , which determines the charge transfer across the heterostructure . We theoretically probed the variation in the band alignment upon to different concentration , where the intrinsic type - II band alignment is preserved at low concentration , and evolves into the type - III broken - gap alignment by heavily doping . Hence , the realization of diverse functions with the forward rectifying diode , backward rectifying diode , NDR diode , and ohmic resistance has been illustrated . They therefore suggest the promising opportunities to be applied for future integration in the scaled electronics .",the doping concentration,21,24,a proper band,80,83,The precise control of the doping concentration endows a proper band bending for the desired band alignment.

The nodes in the rectangle represent the genes involved in each pathway . Small elliptical nodes represent neurotransmitters such as GABA , serotonin , dopamine , and glutamate . The large ellipse represents the main pathway involved in MDD . The dashed line and the solid line represent the indirect and direct relationship between the parts ; the line of the arrow or breakpoint indicates the activation and inhibition of the action , respectively 5 | CON CLUS IONIn this study , we conducted a systematic analysis on genes genetically associated with MDD . Based on the 255 disease - related genes collected , 73 significantly enriched pathways were identified . Pathway cross talk analysis indicated that three major modules were formed by these biological pathways , with each module including pathways related to cellular signaling transduction or the endocrine control , neuronal function or neurological disorders , and the immune system , respectively . Then , the disease-specific subnetwork was constructed and a number of novel genes potentially involved in MDD were identified . When more candidate genes associated with MDD are identified , the procedure outlined in this study should provide more detailed gene interaction and pathological molecular network on MDD . In addition , information on MDD from other sources can also be integrated into the framework used in this study ; then , we will be able to obtain a more comprehensive and meaningful understanding on the molecular mechanisms on the pathogenesis of ACK OWLED ENTS This study was supported in part by grants from National Key Research and Development Program of China ( 2016YFC0906300 ) , and National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 31271411 and 91746205 ) .

"In this paper , we presented a generic real - time heuristic that provides differentiated services based on a given set of flows and their corresponding severity metric . Furthermore , we demonstrated that the proposed heuristic can be used to offer differentiated services and improve QoS in VANETs . The proposed heuristic intelligently prioritizes the processing of flows in VANETs based on their corresponding severity metric . The problems is formulated as a PMKP , which is proved to be Hard . Due to the complexity of the PMKP , a polynomial time algorithm based on a version of the PMKP formulation is proposed to perform the desired prioritization in . The proposed heuristic is tested against the PMKP solution and a baseline non-prioritized processing approach . Results obtained through simulations with real traffic data demonstrated a minor difference in performance between the proposed heuristic and the PMKP . On the other hand , the proposed heuristic surpasses the baseline non-prioritized approach by 9 to 67 percent more profit in moderate and high congestion scenarios . As the results suggest , differentiated services are not required when the system has resources to satisfy all the requests , but rather when the system is under higher loads . In such scenarios , results show that our proposed prioritized processing heuristic is superior and provides better performance .",the PMKP,88,90,a polynomial time,91,94,The PMKP is represented using a polynomial time algorithm.

"A preliminary conclusion of this comparative analysis is that internally consistent decision processes can still result in very large losses when uncertainty is high . These losses are due to lack of external correspondence of the decision maker 's judgment . By contrast , PuCC may be subject to some potential for internal inconsistencies , but it enables better external correspondence in this model since it involves many experts in the decision and focuses their attention on things that are important to the decision outcome . An alternative interpretation of the simulation results is that the DBD framework was overly penalized in this model by restriction to a single decision maker . The DBD framework does not preclude the individual decision maker from gathering and incorporating the views of several experts , so perhaps the single expert should be given a lower value than any one of the multiple experts that are individually contributing to the PuCC process .",PuCC,44,45,several experts,129,131,no relation found

This paper has presented an energy - and mobility - aware scheduling framework for perpetual tracking applications . At the core of this framework is an adaptive informationbased tracking strategy that maximizes the tracking information return subject to a given energy budget . Our strategy uses historical motion statistics and distance from the destination to forecast activity duration to strategically select the best GPS sampling policy . It also predicts energy availability to set a virtual energy budget for a future sampling period . The algorithm then updates its forecast and adapts its acceptable error threshold in response to mobility forecast and energy availability .

"The StereoDIC data acquisition system has been successfully implemented in uniaxial compression testing of rock cores as an alternative to conventional data acquisition systems . The use of non-contacting Ster-eoDIC systems in such applications captures the full field shape , deformation and strain fields on the surface of the specimen compared to conventional strain gages and LVDTs that record average values at discrete locations . Therefore , although the precision of the StereoDIC deformation measurements can be as high as the precision of conventional instrumentation , the accuracy of the StereoDIC technology is superior from the perspective of the correctness of the results .

"Consumer product design needs design evaluation for obtaining information about consumers ' preferences and liking to optimize market success . Such evaluations are usually conducted in simple single - shot studies where consumers only once have to evaluate , for instance , the attractiveness of a design . However , innovative designs often break common visual habits by combining more or less familiar parts into a new concept ( Carbon and Leder in Appl Cogn Psychol 19:587-601 , 2005 ) . Thus , when design innovation is realized in a too advanced way , such designs are expected to be rejected by perceivers at first glance due to low familiarity . However , from everyday experience , we know that consumers ' liking of products often is a dynamic process , which cannot be captured by simple single - shot studies . Carbon and Leder ( Appl Cogn Psychol 19:587-601 , 2005 ) have proposed the repeated evaluation technique ( RET ) for measuring such dynamic effects , which we have combined here with the measurement of electrodermal activity ( EDA ) . The EDA data demonstrated that the RET captured dynamic effects , as the EDA showed specific sensitivity for highly innovative material only after the RET had been conducted ; a cross with the same material analyzing item-specific boredom revealed that participants were much more bored by low innovative material over time than by highly innovative material . Thus RET seems to be a valuable tool for relevant affordances of design evaluation , particularly when innovative designs have to be evaluated .",Leder,71,72,Carbon,69,70,Leder and Carbon are two authors.

"Although the concept of user experience includes two key aspects , experience of meaning ( usability ) and experience of emotion ( affect ) , the empirical work that measures both the usability and affective aspects of user experience is currently limited . This is particularly important considering that affect could significantly influence a user 's perception of usability . This paper uses image schemas to quantitatively and systematically evaluate both these aspects . It proposes a method for evaluating user experience that is based on using image schemas , sentiment analysis , and computational semantics . The aim is to link the sentiments expressed by users during their interactions with a product to the specific image schemas used in the designs . The method involves semantic and sentiment analysis of the verbal responses of the users to identify ( i ) task - related words linked to the task for which a certain image schema has been used and ( ii ) affect - related words associated with the image schema employed in the interaction . The main contribution is in linking image schemas with interaction and affect . The originality of the method is twofold . First , it uses a domain-specific ontology of image schemas specifically developed for the needs of this study . Second , it employs a novel ontology - based algorithm that extracts the image schemas employed by the user to complete a specific task and identifies and links the sentiments expressed by the user with the specific image schemas used in the task . The proposed method is evaluated using a case study involving 40 participants who completed a set task with two different products . The results show that the method successfully links the users ' experiences to the specific image schemas employed to complete the task . This method facilitates significant improvements in product design practices and usability studies in particular , as it allows qualitative and quantitative evaluation of designs by identifying specific image schemas and product design features that have been positively or negatively received by the users . This allows user experience to be assessed in a systematic way , which leads to a better understanding of the value associated with particular design features .",The aim,97,99,a better understanding,365,368,The aim of linking sentiments to image schemas leads to a better understanding of value.

Using the weighted average described above , a mixture of direct and co-transformed subtractions will complete with 58 percent of the FP delay . Multiplications are about 14 times faster . With a reduction to 45 nm fabrication , these speeds could only improve . The LNS design does occupy almost three times the area of the FP unit , but applying a 50 percent reduction as one moves from 65 to 45 nm , it would become 1.5 times the size . The comparison would then have to account for the assumed size of an FP division unit . If this were taken to be , say 25 percent of that of the adder and multiplier , then this LNS design might occupy 1.2 times the area of the FP unit . This improvement to 58 percent of the delay ( or better at 45 nm ) with 1.2 times the area seems roughly consistent with the results observed at 0.18 mm : 70 percent of the delay with equal area .",the delay,47,49,1.2 times the area,195,199,no relation found
"In addition to the above contention on what normative stance ecolinguistics should take , it is also worthwhile for us to consider whether the notion of ( ecological ) justice could be better incorporated into future ecolinguistics research . The analysis of the surveyed journal publications has found very few instances where ( ecological ) justice issues have been explicated addressed . This is by no means an indication that ecolinguistics does not care about ( ecological ) justice . Are concerns over language diversity or English 's over-dominance as a global lingual - franca not an implicit expression of liberal pluralism ? Given the notion of justice ' close connotation with improper distribution and unfairness , it is unfortunate to find that the commitment to ( ecological ) justice , at least among the surveyed publications , remains a less-elaborated aspect .

"Second , the existence of differing creative approaches has implication for support . There is evidence that certain approaches are better applied in early - stage and later stages , and so evidence that certain approaches should theoretically be encouraged or discouraged in each stage . However , as the approach followed is designer - centric and determined by their personal approach , there is a question of how each may be supported . Depending on individual typical approach and that which typically produces better results , there may be numerous methods of supporting behaviour and altering the way that people work .

This research highlights the risk of leakage of potentially sensitive information from one application to another , potentially malicious , application . The results have shown that even with very simple models a good level of accuracy can be achieved , by using more computationally expensive approaches such as dynamic time warping this can be significantly improved .

"Taken together , what this study revealed so far provides two meaningful insights for understanding developmental aspects of Korean-speaking L2 learners of English in their beginning stage of language acquisition . First , L2 learners ' pathway to acquisition of the target language may be guided by characteristics of input that is provided . The current research shows that instruction skewed towards English ASCs with their representative verbs boosted participants ' comprehension of the target language system . Also , despite the fact that the participants did not overcome the complexity of three - argument constructions , the manner in which they were instructed allowed them to produce sentence patterns centred on verbs that were representative of the target constructions . These observations may thus indicate the connection between the frequency - sensitive exposure to English ASCs - verb sets and language behaviours by Korean-speaking L2 learners of English . Second , language learners ' employment of human domaingeneral cognitive factors may coordinate the overall progress of language acquisition . As explained earlier , during ( and after ) the exposure to English ASCs with their representative verbs , the participants in this study utilised narrowly fixed combinations of language items repetitively and fused their prior language knowledge into new sentential information salient to what they were given . Therefore , the behaviours manifested by the participants may suggest the gradual growth of the target language system driven by cognitive endeavour , thereby corresponding to the major assumptions of usage - based constructional approaches to language development . presented in the Constructionist Approaches to Language Pedagogy 2 conference ( 2016 , June ) and the 35th Second Language Research Forum ( 2016 , September ) ; my sincere gratitude goes to the session chairperson of the Constructionist Approaches to Language Pedagogy 2 conference , Catherine Diederich , and anonymous reviewers and participants of the two conferences for many helpful comments .

All these students were studying at upper-intermediate level ( course code 030 ) and had submitted their IELTS overall band score of 6 as part of their admission . To get assurance as the homogeneity of groups in terms of language proficiency level , all participants took an online DIALANG test and only students who achieved level B2 were invited to attend the program . Out of 91 students who achieved B2 , only 72 students attended the peer review training workshop that was mandatory for entering the program . Therefore , the study sample comprised of 47 female and 25 male students , coming from various nationalities ( Iranian , Indian , Chinese , Russian , Mexican , Indonesian , Sri Lankan , and Turkish ) with ages ranged between 22 and 34 with an average of 26 . The participants did not have any peer review training prior to the program . Students were purposefully divided into the MMPR ( = 36 ) and FFPR group ( = 36 ) . To reflect the diversity of the population , both males and females , and students from various nationalities were placed in each group . The FFPR participants were divided into three classes with 12 students in each , and MMPR students were invited to 3 Telegram groups of 12 students .

"Policy implications concerning this finding need adequate formulations such that farmers ' welfare will increase . In this case , worse - off farmers should be the primary target because they would respond much to allocate more resources for intensive chilli agribusiness . A strong recommendation to the policy - makers ( government ) is to reform marketing system and price regulation related to chilli and other horticultural products . So far , the price of chilli is very volatile , and it provides adverse impacts on both consumers and chilli farmers . One of the potential sources of price volatility is the absence of government regulation applied to horticultural products including chilli . Horticultural price is floating and dependent on the market supply and demand . As chilli is a strategic commodity that contributes to economic inflation in the country , the price regulation will guarantee farmers ' expectation on chilli price both during peak season and off-season . The government should also establish agribusiness terminals and marketing infrastructure in many potential chilli-producing regions to increase market efficiency , which means that the harvest during peak season can be absorbed and distributed evenly to other marketing regions . In the long run , the existence of agribusiness stations near production centres enables farmers to sell their produce promptly . Market failure , or inability of the existing market in clearing the seasonal production of chilli , is the major cause of the very low price of chilli . As chilli is perishable , if the current agribusiness stations fail in clearing the product , the unsold chilli will perish in the market . Thus , postharvest handling facilities should also be provided .",Market failure,220,222,adverse impacts,84,86,Market failure is one of the adverse impacts of the price of chili.

"In the previous section we showed the inconsistency of the nonlocal strain gradient theory when applied to bounded solids . The drawback has been extensively exemplified by the study of a 1D elastostatic problem : a Euler beam submitted to axial and transverse loads . The solution of this problem has to satisfy three kinds of boundary conditions : standard , non-standard and constitutive . The standard and non-standard boundary conditions come from the application of Principle of Minimum Total Potential Energy and they are necessary to fulfil equilibrium . The non-standard ones are a consequence of the consideration of the strain gradient field in the formulation of the model . The constitutive boundary conditions arise from the integral character of the constitutive equations , and they have also to be accomplished . Therefore , as it has been presented in the previous sections , the studied problem is ill- posed since the number of boundary conditions is higher than the order of the differential operator . In this section we discuss the consistency of other nonlocal elastic theories which also use the constitutive equations in integral form , namely , a ) nonlocal strain - driven elasticity ; two - phase local / non - local strain - driven elasticity ; ) nonlocal stress - driven elasticity ; d) two - phase local / non - local stress - driven elasticity .",The solution,45,47,boundary conditions,56,58,The solution of this problem has to satisfy three kinds of boundary conditions.

"Studies on phonetic accommodation have found that the process is affected by many different factors , of which perceptual salience seems to be one . The conflicting findings of studies that have explored the effect of salience on phonetic accommodation might be partly explained by the use of differing methods of defining salience . The purpose of this paper was to provide a critical evaluation of two approaches to defining salience by explaining how they work , discussing studies that have applied them , and comparing the two approaches in terms of four aspects . The comparison found more disadvantages for the criteria list approach since it faces difficulties in capturing individual variation in perception , the social meaning of dialect variation , and the nature of salience as gradient . In x5 , the two approaches were split apart into three : the objective criteria , the subjective criteria , and the experimental approach . It was suggested that the nature of the information that these approaches capture about salience might be different and that they might align better with different types of studies on accommodation . In particular , perhaps the criteria list approach would work better for larger studies in which the data come from historical linguistic patterns , while the experimental approach would be more appropriate for studies of individuals ' patterns of short - term phonetic accommodation . Determining how well these different approaches align with studies aimed at different levels will be left to future work .",the effect,33,35,studies,29,30,The effect of salience is explored in studies.

In addition , the interference from non-critical sections can be determined once all higher priority tasks are partitioned .

"A third reason for choosing COCA is its availability . Choosing a freely and easily accessible corpus is relevant not only in view of research resource limitations but also given the research desiderata of openness and replicability , which require that the primary data be easily assessed by other scholars . COCA fulfills this by being freely available once one has created a user account . This contrasts with other large contemporary corpora of English , such as the Bank of English ( a subset of COBUILD ) , which is accessible only for a substantial fee , and the Oxford English Corpus , whose accessibility outside lexicographers working at the publisher administering the corpus is limited . Given these considerations ( i.e. , contemporariness , size , and availability ) , COCA is a better alternative than many other available English corpora for my purposes , since it provides a large and accessible sample of how nano is currently used . However , this choice ( like any other choice of corpora ) has consequences for interpreting the findings . Perhaps the most urgent issue concerns how representative COCA is .

"In dependence on the basic principle of optimal control for distribution network , considering the popularization of EV devices in BIES , an optimization strategy is put forward in this paper . The strategy combines the pricing mechanism in the buildings and the dynamic compensation of the energy storage device , which is designed to balance the optimization between system power loss and node voltage fluctuation . By simulation analysis and comparison on the MATLAB , the overall ability of the optimization strategy is illustrated . Firstly , BIES provides access for EV , enhancing more space for schedulable resource capacity . Next , introduction of EV coordinated dispatch by the TOU price mechanism promotes their initiative and utilization , and alleviates the power supply demand of the distribution network by load peak shaving and valley filling . Finally , under the condition of basic constraints , the optimal solution of compensation plan by capacitor banks can be determined through an improved genetic algorithm . After scheduled charging / discharging of EV and reactive compensation , the active power loss and risk of node voltage out - of - limit are improved simultaneously , promoting the economical and safe operation of the distribution network . This optimal strategy can be extended to other cases , and has great significance for the optimal management of power grid .",the basic principle,3,6,the pricing mechanism,35,38,The basic principle asks the strategy combines the pricing mechanism.
"With regard to the positioning of Dane s' progression types in the two newspapers , there is no obvious pattern as to where in a text they most often occur .

"( 9 ) Despite the conditions for glide formation being satisfied by examples in ( 9 ) , elision takes place . We therefore can thus argue for 1 elision , precisely for these examples , as opposed to glide formation in instances in which the 2 in the sequence is the mid back vowel We can also argue that this is not coalescence because typically , ( isi ) Ndebele as is the case with many Bantu languages does not exhibit evidence of instances of symmetric coalescence . Coalescence in ( isi ) Ndebele is largely asymmetric . Instances of vowel coalescence in ( isi ) Ndebele are largely asymmetric and are thus triggered by specific serial orderings of the vowels straddling a word boundary and are in line with the Dokean thesis on coalescence in Bantu languages expressed in example ( 15 ) . Arguing for coalescence instead of elision thus would imply arguing for rare cases of symmetric coalescence in the language .

"In the case studies , issues identified through physical testing are often addressed by rework in the next stage Thus , it is expected that the insights will not all be applicable in other engineering design contexts . For example , in very large - scale projects such as aircraft design or system - ofsystem development , system - level testing from the beginning of the process ( e.g. , using the equivalent of the MULE trucks / engines discussed earlier ) is typically not possible . The insights presented here would need to be extended to cover this and other differences , and further empirical work is needed to do so . Additional future research directions may be suggested . First , there is a need to develop prescriptive process models to convey best practices relating to testing and its integration with the design process . The literature study of 3 revealed that testing practice depends ( or should depend ) on features of the design context , and this should be reflected in such models . Second , comparison of the empirical insights with the mathematical and simulation models of testing reviewed in 3.1 also reveals some gaps that could be explored using such models , and accordingly some opportunities for research .

"A novel concept of self contained actuators unit in wide area control of damping in power system for nominal system condition under different operating points as well as for system affected by actuator faults is presented in the paper . A wide area robust damping controller is designed to meet multiple objectives from disturbance attenuation to ensuring minimum damping in system . Infinity norm minimization of closed loop transfer function and pole placement criterion is used in the design of wide area robust damping controller . The use of multiple output wide area controller feeding multiple actuators in power system allows for higher damping and fast settling of power oscillations in system . The wide area damping controller is tested for different operating conditions and controller is found suitable in providing sufficient damping in system compared to open loop system . The reconfigurable control design following fault hiding principle that is added to wide area controller is found to maintain sufficient system damping on actuator faults taking place in system . The reconfiguration component is activated on actuator fault and together with remaining active actuators from the same group ( earlier to actuator fault ) stabilizes system response . The group of actuators involved in wide area control and damping act as an self sufficient actuators unit for maintaining system damping and preserving system response even in the case of actuator faults . The reconfiguration component is dynamic and assumes parameters that changes with respect to change in actuator fault but together with remaining active actuators act to maintain system damping level to pre-fault condition . On actuator fault wide area control signal is redistributed to the remaining active actuators by the reconfiguration component . A two area power system model is considered for implementing the proposed methods of designing ( i ) robust wide area damping controller and ( ii ) reconfiguration component to test their effectiveness in damping control . The results obtained show that reconfigurable control design for wide area damping controller having multiple outputs makes for an self contained actuators unit capable to maintain sufficient damping in system with or without actuator fault , under different operating points and independent of use of any redundant actuators .",self,4,5,the design,77,79,no relation found

"To understand how the chain works , we can first think of it as an exponent sorter . On each cycle , two neighbors are compared . If they are in the appropriate order , the exponent of the value in the smaller position is larger than the exponent of the value in the larger position : they remain in the same position . If they are out of order , the positions are swapped to place them in order . The two stages guarantee that each cycle through the distill chain will compare each value with its left and right neighbors , allowing it to move one position to the left or right in each cycle . If the elements are properly ordered , then no values change positions in a cycle . In the worst case , a value moves from one end of the chain to the other , a total of positions . Now consider the FPART units instead of sort units . On each cycle , we add two floating - point values . If the values do not overlap , the FPART simply sorts the values by the exponent . When the values overlap , the FPART adds the values and the sum output , s , has a larger exponent than the residue output , r , so the outputs are also in sorted order . However , unlike a sorter , the values that come out can be very different from the ones that went in . Due to cancellation , they could both have smaller exponents . When the signs of the values are the same , we can end up with a larger exponent for the s output and a smaller one for Either case may leave the results unsorted within the distill chain . However , if we continue to cycle the chain , the values will be moved to their proper position where they will potentially interact to produce a new sum and residue .",the elements,119,121,each cycle,19,21,The elements are sorted in each cycle.

Moreover , to check the validity of the formulation , we compare the analytical results with the numerical outcomes obtained from an independent finite element model .

Apparently , patterns 8 , 2 and 1 were used more frequently than the others on the cloze test , which suggests that the chance of choosing a correct answer by guessing is less on the cloze test than on the MCGF test . Patterns 9 and 5 , which outperformed the others , add to the score validity of both tests .",Pattern,76,77,12 times,95,97,Pattern 9 was associated with the better students (9 of 12 times on the cloze test)

"Farmers ' knowledge , represented by adulthood and experiences in any farming , stimulated them to engage in intensive farming . Credit access and technology adoption played a substantial role in encouraging farmers to engage in agribusiness of chilli . Credit and technology should be available at the same time . Credit was used as operating capital in intensive farming , which was commonly higher than the conventional one . Adoption of improved technology led to high production and eventually increased welfare . The distance of marketplace , or agribusiness station , to farm location also contributed an important role . The closer the marketplace is to farming , the more likely are farmers going to engage in the chilli-based agribusiness . It is very sensible because farmers should sell the product in a fresh form . Chilli is perishable , and thus long delay in the transportation will reduce the quality of chilli . Traders or customers determined farmers ' intention to engage in intensive farming . The timely availability of traders ensured that the product is marketable . Engagement in agribusiness of chilli was indirectly influenced by market information and the use of the telephone through the mediation of technology and credit . The role of the telephone was indirectly significant via the mediation of farmers ' access to credit and technology adoption , which was also dependent on other exogenous factors .

"This part of the section demonstrates working of self contained actuators unit in restoring system performance in event of actuator faults taking place in wide area control of power system . The reconfigurable control on actuator fault restructures feedback loop such that WAC driven by multiple actuators makes for an self contained actuators unit capable of restoring system performance without depending on any redundant actuator outside the unit . The reconfiguration component ( RC ) embedded in the feedback loop gets activated on actuator fault and redistributes the wide area control input from WRDC among the remaining active actuators of the unit . The design implementation of reconfigurable control shows onlineactivation of reconfiguration component ( RC ) on actuator fault . This results in two reconfigured signals ( & ) at input and output of WRDC , hiding actuator fault from it . In design implementation along with reconfigured signals shown are actual output and input signals of power system ( & ) respectively . The redistribution of control signal by RC on actuator fault to remaining active actuators is seen in actual input signal ( ) .

The study 's inclusive approach compared to the more conventional approach , in which researchers count only those moves in standard sections , such as the introduction and conclusion , has resulted in differences in results in introductory and concluding moves . For introductory moves , although there was no difference in conventional moves , the difference was the increased frequency of Move 2 , Step 1 , Move 2 , Step 2 , and Move 3 , Step 1 in environmental engineering , which helped to reveal the cycling nature of the moves in that field .",the study,46,48,this inclusion,98,100,no relation found
"The key operation in our tree reduce is the FPART unit . For completeness , this section describes the design of the FPART unit and quantifies its resources . We start by describing the base FPA design and its extension to an FPAR that supports "" round - to -nearest , ties - away - from - 0 "" , the most complex of the IEEE - 754 rounding modes .",this section,15,17,the FPART unit,8,11,This section describes the design of the FPART unit.
"Lacking in experience , most Millennials face uncertainty and disorientation in the occurrence of conflicts and tensions that involve their older subordinates . In the occurrence of conflict or tensions , the initial response is to disregard and ignore the issue or elevate it to the immediate superior for guidance . Ignoring and disregarding the issue is justified by the assumption that older employees are "" mature enough "" to handle these situations . The participants may lack the knowledge and understanding to recognize conflicts that are caused by generational differences . Worse , they may fail to recognize that ignoring such issues may lead to damaging effects on may be provided to enhance the employee morale , motivation , and productivity .",experience,2,3,older employees,62,64,Experience is obtained by older employees.
"Here we see some overlap between Trudgill 's criteria and those proposed by other authors . Within the objective criteria , articulatory distance could be the same as Trudgill 's phonetically radically different criterion if the term ' phonetic ' is meant to include articulatory and not just acoustic measures . It is expected that the greater the distance , the more salient the difference between the variants will be . Similarly , phonemicity ( equivalent to Trudgill 's involved in phonological contrast ) will cause a variant to be salient . The more geographically widespread a given dialectal variant is geographically , the more salient it is predicted to be ( areal distribution ) . The continuous versus dichotomous criterion suggests that linguistic variables that have only two variants with no intermediate forms are more salient than those that have a gradient realization . Variables involved in phonological rules that are lexicalized ( i.e. only apply in particular lexical items ) are predicted to be more salient than those that apply uniformly throughout the lexicon ( lexicalization ) . Within the subjective criteria , the greater the perceptual distance between a dialect 1 ( D1 ) and a dialect 2 ( D2 ) variant , the greater the salience . A variant is predicted to be salient if it is used in ( usage in ) or in writings by ( representation in lay dialect writing ) . Overlapping with Trudgill 's stigmatization criterion , the stereotyping / mimicking criterion suggests that those variants that are included when imitating or joking about a dialect will be salient . Lastly , if the difference between a D1 and a D2 variant is likely to hinder comprehensibility , then the difference is said to be salient .",the objective criteria,17,20,usage,224,225,no relation found
