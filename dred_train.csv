"The paper is organised as follows . In Section 2 , we develop the formulation for the transient motion of a gyroscopic spinner connected to a mass embedded in a finite truss of elastic rods . There , we also provide illustrative examples that demonstrate how the model can be used to characterise the transient behaviour of the system . Moreover , to check the validity of the formulation , we compare the analytical results with the numerical outcomes obtained from an independent finite element model . In Section 3 , we consider periodic elastic systems connected to arrays of gyroscopic spinners . Specifically , we focus on a triangular elastic medium connected to two types of spinners and show how to realise highly localised waveforms in this medium in the transient regime . The second problem considered involves a gyro-elastic hexagonal lattice containing an interface defined by a heterogeneous system of spinners and we provide transient simulations demonstrating how to produce unidirectional interfacial waves . In Section 4 , two important applications for a hexagonal gyro-elastic lattice are presented . First , we discuss the problem of topological protection in a lattice with a hexagonal domain that contains a cavity and is excited on the exterior boundary . There , unidirectional edge waves travel along the external boundary of the lattice , leaving the interior almost undisturbed . Second , we design a discrete gyro-elastic invisibility cloak , which is capable of hiding a defect in a periodic structured medium . In Section 5 we provide some concluding remarks . In the appendices , we give additional details on the angular momentum balance of the gyroscopic spinner and on the dispersion relations of the elastic lattices considered in this paper .",Section,8,9,the interior,224,226,no relation found
"The problem of parameter identification for a slightly perturbed inhomogeneous isotropic elastic medium is considered with application to indentation stiffness tomography . A approach is applied to evaluate the contact stiffness of the inhomogeneous medium for a frictionless flat-ended cylindrical indenter . The cases of homogeneous spherical , hemispherical , and semi-infinite cylindrical inclusions embedded in a reference homogeneous medium represented by an elastic half - space are considered in detail . The so-called inhomogeneity sensitivity factors are introduced to estimate the characteristic size of inhomogeneity from the indentation data obtained from indenters of three different radii . The effect of elastic invisibility of inclusion to the indentation sensing is discussed . Based on the technique , an approach is proposed for locating and identifying a spherical inhomogeneity buried in an elastic half - space , which utilizes the indentation stiffness data collected from the half - space surface .",parameter identification,3,5,the characteristic size,81,84,no relation found

This validation test demonstrates that the change of ICP during an infusion test can be successfully modelled by the numerical simulation . Both the infusion and decay stages , which are separated by the peak of ICP , are distinctively captured . It should be noted that the high frequency fluctuations of ICP from experiments are mainly caused by arterial pressure pulsations , which are not considered in the numerical modelling due to the lack of experimental data to quantify the input parameters .

"Obviously , in order to meet the required functionality set forth , the inversion should ultimately be able to identify a symmetric KC model , with an isotropic equivalent model , even when the optimisation is performed using a full ( 21 moduli ) anisotropic constitutive model . This is a challenge due to the fact that no coupling between terms of compression strains to shear strains , implies that most of the 21 terms in the Hooke 's matrix should be zero for an isotropic equivalent . For this validation case , a set of target displacements are numerically generated using the KC model , in the following also referred to as the measured displacements in order to emphasise that they stem from experiments . To verify the generality of the approach , a priori , expected , material symmetry is not taken into account in the inverse estimation , and the equivalent material is addressed as fully anisotropic . As the characterisation of the symmetric KC model is expected to be the most sensitive case to deficiencies and uncertainties in the meshing , the following aspects will be investigated for this case : the influence of the geometry and the boundary conditions , the experimentally - related ambiguity in the evaluation of the target displacements discussed in Section 2.7 , and the influence of the number of cells in the KC array together with the mesh density in the equivalent solid .

"The issue of applicability of the Morphologically Representative Pattern ( MRP ) approach to elastic-plastic composites is addressed . The extension to the regime of non-linear material behaviour is performed by employing the concept of incremental linearization of the material response in two basic variants : tangent and secant . The obtained predictions are evaluated through comparison with the outcomes of numerical analyses . Finite Element simulations are carried out using periodic unit cells with cubic arrangements of spherical particles and representative volume elements ( RVE ) with 50 randomly placed inclusions . In addition to the analysis of the packing effect in two - phase composites , the size effect is also studied by assuming an interphase between the matrix and inclusions .

"The influence of the particle size and packing on the overall elastic-plastic properties of metal- matrix composites has been analyzed . The field Morphologically Representative Pattern ( MRP ) approach , originally developed to address linear material behaviour , has been adapted to account for non-linearity . Within the proposed MRP formulation , a particulate composite microstructure has been represented by two patterns : one with a spherical inclusion surrounded by a layer having a thickness defined by the mean minimum distance between particles in the representative volume , and the second one carrying the remaining pure matrix material . Both patterns are embedded in a homogenized effective medium . The mean minimum distance parameter describes the packing ( clustering ) of the particles .

"Cloud service certifications ( CSC ) attempt to assure a high level of security and compliance .

"velocity was found to be an effective way to both lower chip temperature and increase FCA power generation . However due to a stronger dependence on the flow velocity , the related increase in pumping power outweighs the power generation gain when flow velocity reaches a certain critical value . The maximum flow velocity in our simulations was 2.5 for channels 100 mm high and 50 mm wide , restricted by the aforementioned pressure drop constraint , which is still lower than the critical velocity . For channels with larger , hydraulic resistance is lower , and flow velocity can exceed either the critical value or the laminar flow constraints before the corresponded pressure drop reaches its limit . Finally , inlet temperature can also be increased to maximize FCA power generation , accepting a trade - off with the maximum chip temperature . However , the leakage power rise due to the higher MPU temperature outweighs the FCA power generation increase . Therefore , given the current 22 nm MPU architecture under analysis , it seems reasonable to keep the inlet temperature low for this specific simulation scenario . On the other hand , note that elevated fluid temperatures are beneficial in terms of heat rejection to ambient , and by allowing free cooling at the facility level , an overall energetic benefit in the case of higher inlet temperatures is still likely to be incurred .",elevated fluid temperatures,197,200,a certain critical value,45,49,no relation found

"The qualitative scores for the power interconnects are calculated by counting the number of power interconnects in each layer of the 2D/3D chip stack . This is then normalized with respect to the total number of interconnects that is physically possible to be realized in a 3D chip stack . This normalization ensures a fair comparison between designs of different physical sizes . The number of power interconnects for MPUs are counted double that for memory chips . This is to resolve a qualitative difference between the two . It is assumed that the signal interconnects needed between the MPU and the memory chip , and the signal interconnects needed between the 3D stack and devices outside of the package are determined by the bandwidth requirements , and are fixed . These interconnects are counted as a single unit each . The total possible number of interconnects in a 2D/3D chip stack is calculated by assuming that each layer is populated by all possible interconnects , i.e. : 1 ) power interconnects for MPU ( 2 units ) , 2 ) power interconnects for memory ( 1 unit ) , 3 ) signal TSVs ( 1 unit ) , which represent a maximum total of 4 units per layer that carries interconnects . Since in all our configurations , the TC is always facing down , it never contains any TSVs / interconnects in that layer and is not counted .

"ANSYS Fluent software uses five different types of heat sinks to establish a channel for simulation analysis and comparison . Although the stepped heat sink has a reduced heat dissipation area , with the increase of the Reynolds number , the overall heat dissipation performance is not necessarily poor . With the increase of the Reynolds number to Re = 40,000 , the overall heat transfer performance is better than the Pin heat sink . Increasing the Reynolds number is helpful to reduce the overall temperature and thermal resistance of the heat sink , but the increase in the Reynolds number gradually decreases the thermal resistance value . Therefore , increasing the Reynolds number is used to improve the heat transfer performance of the heat sink . There are limits . The design concept of material reduction has a significant impact on processing and cost . The results in this article show that the selection of an appropriate heat sink fin and a specific Reynolds number can effectively improve the heat transfer performance of the flat plate heat sink . When three grooves are added , although the surface area is reduced , the overall heat transfer performance is improved .

"The protection principle of flexible DC grid is a key point of the research . At present , the research on fault detection and identification of AC system is mature , but the fault characteristics of flexible DC grid are different . Therefore , the traditional AC protection principle is difficult to be applied in flexible DC grid . On the one hand , the energy storage element in VSC makes the DC fault current rise rapidly ; on the other hand , the network topology expands the influence range of DC faults . In addition , the vulnerability of power electronics equipment also makes the requirements for protection more stringent . The requirement of speed and selectivity of protection principle have become two key issues that need to be addressed in flexible DC grid . In the existing research , the protection methods of flexible DC grids can be roughly divided into several schemes of fault detection and identification such as traveling wave protection , voltage and current protection , boundary protection , pilot protection , and protection - control coordination protection .",the existing research,137,140,voltage,166,167,no relation found

"Compared with common shipboard power networks and land distribution power grids , the floating nuclear power plant grid is compact in structure , and because of the ship hull being used as the ground loop , it is prone to generating different fault forms . Moreover , the reactor loads in the floating nuclear power plant are sensitive to large ground fault current . Thus , the protection method should have high sensitivity to different ground faults . To solve the problems , a protection method in cooperation with the multi-mode grounding control is proposed in this paper . When a ground fault occurs , if the fault current is larger than the threshold value , the system remains grounded with high . The protection method based on WTMM is used , and MUEER is defined to select the optimal wavelet basis and decomposition scale . When HIFs occur , the fault characteristics of the feeders are not obvious because of the signal noise and the limited precision of zero-sequence CT . Under such conditions , multi-mode grounding control is adopted and the system is switched into low-resistance grounding mode to enlarge the fault characteristic .

"Within manufacturing companies , the architectural description of how a product is built is typically well defined while the architecture of the product from a functional view describing how the functional requirements are met in the product is often less articulated . For products composed of many components ( modular products ) such descriptions are clear , whereas few representation schemes are available that treat highly functionally integrated components , where all the functions are satisfied by one integral , homogenous physical structure . In this paper , an approach to describe the architecture for integrated components in the aerospace industry is described . Different regions of the component , termed as sections , are assumed to satisfy the functions required of the structure which are often manufactured by joining ( welding ) different segments . By assigning sectional and functional information to different manufactured segments of the structure , graphs are created that link the functional requirements and sections . Two different methods , one based on set compositions and other on creating an enhanced function - means ( EF - M ) tree are used to link the functions to the sections of the component , resulting in different graphs for different types of manufacturing splits for the same component . Comparison of the methods is then carried out using properties of the graphs produced . The method that utilises set compositions performs well for entire component descriptions while the method that uses an EF - tree to create a graph describes sections ( regions ) of the component well so that functional relationships can be better described ( integration of already existing design knowledge ) .

"The notion of authorised game is central to Walton 's theory . Authorised games are those with an established and socially shared set of rules that can not be arbitrarily changed by the participants in the game , i.e. , the readers .

For example , the Harry Potter books are an authorised game , so that what is "" true "" and "" false "" in the imagination game is defined and agreed . Thus a statement S is fictional in a work if the statement is true in the imaginary world defined by the work . ( Walton did not like the idea of ' fictional world ' preferring to see this just as what follows from the rules of the game ; statements that are fictional are valid in a work in the sense that they are derivable from it . ) This applies both for explicitly stated fictional truths , like ' Draco Malfoy is a member of Slytherin House ' and implied fictional truths like ' Harry Potter is a native speaker of English ' .

The essence of this strategy is educated guessing , which is mainly used when the subject is not entirely sure of the answer . In this study , educated guessing is considered a TW strategy . Thus , the subject 's score for this item is a valid indication of her particular knowledge of the gapped word because it shows that she did not learn the words "" force "" or "" slow "" , which would have been the correct answer .

Thus , it is suggested that making peer comments with the use of mobile applications is effective in developing academic writing skills . ( 2 ) Although the use of mobile applications resulted in a more efficient peer review practice , the FFPR has its own advantages . Approaching peer review from both modes will provide researchers with an overall understanding of group dynamics and expectations . The act of peer review will be more influential when combined with either face - to - face or asynchronous and either FFPR , CMPR , or MMPR modes of communication which encourages students to generate more focused , deliberate peer comments . ( 3 ) Language teachers should encourage interaction exchanges not only in learning environments but in social spaces , especially in CMPR and MMPR . Students should involve in social exchanges in peer review groups to resemble a real - life experience of learning . Moreover , this engagement motivates them to accept their peers ' criticism and integrate their comments into their revisions . Social interaction in peer review provides the opportunity for learners to use English as a means of socialization and communication . ( 4 ) Wellorganized training sessions are required to not only familiarize students with the procedures of peer review , new technologies , and ICT skills . Moreover , explicit instructions are needed , especially for global- oriented comments to prepare the students on what and how to comment on their peers ' writings by considering both global and local issues .",peer review,7,9,"more focused , deliberate peer comments",177,183,no relation found
"In writing assessment , finding a valid , reliable , and efficient scale is critical . Appropriate scales , increase rater reliability , and can also save time and money . This exploratory study compared the effects of a binary scale and an analytic scale across teacher raters and expert raters . The purpose of the study is to find out how different scale types impact rating performance and scores . The raters in this study rated twenty short EFL essays using the two scales , completed a rater cognition questionnaire , and took part in an in-depth interview . The ratings were analyzed using a multi-faceted Rasch analysis to compare essay scores and rater statistics across scales and rater groups . The results indicated when using the binary scale , the raters spent less time and were less spread out and more consistent in their ratings . Three out of four raters replied that less mental effort was required when using the binary scale and felt more confident in their ratings . Across the two rater groups , there was a bigger shift in rating performance when using the binary scale for the teacher raters than the expert raters . This implies that scale design had a greater effect on teacher raters . The overall findings suggest that the binary scale maybe a better fit for large scale assessment with sufficient rater training .",the study,55,57,scales,17,18,The study uses appropriate scales to increase rater reliability.
"Regardless of the different scale design , the expert raters knew there was little difference in the assessment constructs across the scales . When developing scales , attention is usually given to the assessment criteria , descriptors , and scoring methods but not to the layout . From this study , we can say that in addition to the traditional factors considered in scale development , the design factor also has an impact on raters .",When developing scales,23,26,the assessment,32,34,"When developing scales , attention is usually given to the assessment criteria."
"From this study , I found that the binary scale is still not well - known beyond the language assessment community and not widely used . None of the raters who took part in the study had experience using the scale , and the teacher raters did not know of its existence . However , when given the opportunity to use such a scale type , the raters did appreciate the efficiency of the scale and shared a common belief in it as an effective scale , particularly for large scale assessment purposes . From this study , to use binary scales several conditions should be met . First is the need for sufficient rater training . The teacher raters in this study did not have experience in large scale assessment but did have more than 10 years of experience as language teachers .",the raters,28,30,experience,37,38,None of the raters who took part in the study had experience using the scale.
"In addition to rater background , another key factor that influences student essay scores and rater performance are scale types . Among different scale types ( e.g. , holistic , analytic , primary , multiple trait ) , the binary scale is a type of nominal scale that consists of two possible values . Binary scales are developed using the performance - data driven approach ; therefore , it is constructed based on empirical student data . In the field of language testing , EBB , empirically derived descriptorbased diagnostic ( EDD ) checklist , and performance decision trees are binary types of scales . In all binary scales , a series of binary questions ( yes / no ) are given to the rater to make judgments .",another key factor,6,9,scales,55,56,another key factor is different types of scales.
"The number of raters in this study was small and they also possessed different L1 In my research context , recruiting NS instructors for the teacher rater group was not very difficult , but it was challenging to recruit LT professionals for the expert rater group and almost impossible to find NS LT professionals . This resulted in small sample size and different language backgrounds . The teacher raters were native speakers and the expert raters were not . This is a concern but it reflects the character of the educational context I am part of . Small sample size and different L1 backgrounds are the concerns and limitations to the study but as stated earlier , the purpose of this exploratory study is not to generalize the findings but to explore different scale perceptions across different rater groups .

In other words , one evaluator must look empirically at the ability and performance of the cohort in order to decide whether one criterion is acceptable .

"The existing morbidity of English language assessment in Bangladesh discussed above shows that the challenges are numerous . Because of the limited scope of this study , only a few which deserve immediate attention are presented here . First of all , the washback effect needs to be addressed seriously . Assessment practices are hard to change ; however , if initiatives to change the current practices are not taken , they will remain unchanged which will ultimately preclude the adoption of time - appropriate learning styles by the students . Secondly , assessment methods must be compatible with the contemporary expectations of the real world . Hence , the policymakers must think of alternative forms of assessment , at least alternatives in assessment . Finally , emphasis on classroom - based assessment and its integration to the overall assessment scheme is essential as classroom plays a crucial role in successful language learning in an EFL context like Bangladesh .

"We have introduced customizable MFs as cell mimics that have a natural membrane and cytosol interior combined with AOs that produce desired molecules or signals .

In addition , polymersomes loaded with catalytic compounds , such as enzymes , play the role of AOs and support in situ reactions inside MFs . Compared to previously reported artificial cells based on bottom - up approaches , our MFs represent an advance in terms of complexity ( given by the intrinsic composition of GPMVs supplemented by transfer ) and functionality ( supported by in situ enzymatic reactions inside AOs ) that has been proven in vivo . Such MFs open new avenues for understanding bioreactions and functions in a close - to-nature environment . In addition , by systematic optimization of the conditions in which MFs are produced , it is possible to control the amount of synthetic cargoes with which these artificial cells are equipped . This control can be used to favor a specific interaction , reinforce stability , or tune the overall efficiency of the reactions inside the AOs , as an essential step towards medical applications . Further , our experiments with ZFEs show that these MFs are nontoxic , and can successfully persist in vivo while retaining their integrity and functionality .

"Farmers ' knowledge , represented by adulthood and experiences in any farming , stimulated them to engage in intensive farming . Credit access and technology adoption played a substantial role in encouraging farmers to engage in agribusiness of chilli . Credit and technology should be available at the same time . Credit was used as operating capital in intensive farming , which was commonly higher than the conventional one . Adoption of improved technology led to high production and eventually increased welfare . The distance of marketplace , or agribusiness station , to farm location also contributed an important role . The closer the marketplace is to farming , the more likely are farmers going to engage in the chilli-based agribusiness . It is very sensible because farmers should sell the product in a fresh form . Chilli is perishable , and thus long delay in the transportation will reduce the quality of chilli . Traders or customers determined farmers ' intention to engage in intensive farming . The timely availability of traders ensured that the product is marketable . Engagement in agribusiness of chilli was indirectly influenced by market information and the use of the telephone through the mediation of technology and credit . The role of the telephone was indirectly significant via the mediation of farmers ' access to credit and technology adoption , which was also dependent on other exogenous factors . Sources of credit and simplicity of accessing credit gave a vital function .

"public discourse on the human rights issue in North Korea has not been examined previously .

Next , it reframes the discourse using a coding schema based on the convergence of the human rights , human security , and non-traditional security discourses .

"A third sort of scenario is possible if one steps back from the assumption of a closed agricultural sector . Economic growth resulting from either a resource boom or increased saving and investment could occur in an open economy setting . Thus , the main food staples could be imported without a rise in their cost . Thus , employment growth in manufacturing could occur by drawing labour out of agriculture , and thus the share of manufacturing in employment would rise . However , if the state sought to insulate domestic agricultural production from the international market this would raise the relative cost of staple foods and thus the real wage of labour . The latter would limit growth in manufacturing employment and thus the share of such employment would likely stagnate or decline .

"Within manufacturing companies , the architectural description of how a product is built is typically well defined while the architecture of the product from a functional view describing how the functional requirements are met in the product is often less articulated . For products composed of many components ( modular products ) such descriptions are clear , whereas few representation schemes are available that treat highly functionally integrated components , where all the functions are satisfied by one integral , homogenous physical structure . In this paper , an approach to describe the architecture for integrated components in the aerospace industry is described . Different regions of the component , termed as sections , are assumed to satisfy the functions required of the structure which are often manufactured by joining ( welding ) different segments . By assigning sectional and functional information to different manufactured segments of the structure , graphs are created that link the functional requirements and sections . Two different methods , one based on set compositions and other on creating an enhanced function - means ( EF - M ) tree are used to link the functions to the sections of the component , resulting in different graphs for different types of manufacturing splits for the same component . Comparison of the methods is then carried out using properties of the graphs produced . The method that utilises set compositions performs well for entire component descriptions while the method that uses an EF - tree to create a graph describes sections ( regions ) of the component well so that functional relationships can be better described ( integration of already existing design knowledge ) . The product descriptions created can help designers to identify how alternative manufacturing splits impact the functionally defined product architecture which in turn enables both improved manufacturing and improved design decisions .",modular products,49,51,few representation schemes,58,61,"Modular products have clear descriptions of architectures, while highly integrated components have few representation schemes."

"Within manufacturing companies , the architectural description of how a product is built is typically well defined while the architecture of the product from a functional view describing how the functional requirements are met in the product is often less articulated . For products composed of many components ( modular products ) such descriptions are clear , whereas few representation schemes are available that treat highly functionally integrated components , where all the functions are satisfied by one integral , homogenous physical structure . In this paper , an approach to describe the architecture for integrated components in the aerospace industry is described . Different regions of the component , termed as sections , are assumed to satisfy the functions required of the structure which are often manufactured by joining ( welding ) different segments . By assigning sectional and functional information to different manufactured segments of the structure , graphs are created that link the functional requirements and sections . Two different methods , one based on set compositions and other on creating an enhanced function - means ( EF - M ) tree are used to link the functions to the sections of the component , resulting in different graphs for different types of manufacturing splits for the same component . Comparison of the methods is then carried out using properties of the graphs produced . The method that utilises set compositions performs well for entire component descriptions while the method that uses an EF - tree to create a graph describes sections ( regions ) of the component well so that functional relationships can be better described ( integration of already existing design knowledge ) . The product descriptions created can help designers to identify how alternative manufacturing splits impact the functionally defined product architecture which in turn enables both improved manufacturing and improved design decisions .",different types,203,205,the functional requirements,29,32,no relation found

"If we consider the methods of defining salience in this way , split into objective criteria , subjective criteria , and the experimental approach , it seems that the nature of the information that they capture about salience is different .

Perhaps these approaches to defining salience are best applied to different types of studies investigating patterns of accommodation at distinct levels . For example , in studies looking at how salience affects short term patterns of phonetic accommodation , where a relatively small group of participants take part in a laboratory experiment , applying the experimental approach to capture those individuals ' specific patterns is feasible and would allow an examination of and intra-speaker variation in perception . In larger - scale studies looking at community - level patterns of accommodation , especially those that involve changes over time , testing individual speakers would not be feasible and , in fact , could introduce variability into the definition of salience that might not be relevant at that high level .

"The protection principle of flexible DC grid is a key point of the research . At present , the research on fault detection and identification of AC system is mature , but the fault characteristics of flexible DC grid are different . Therefore , the traditional AC protection principle is difficult to be applied in flexible DC grid . On the one hand , the energy storage element in VSC makes the DC fault current rise rapidly ; on the other hand , the network topology expands the influence range of DC faults . In addition , the vulnerability of power electronics equipment also makes the requirements for protection more stringent . The requirement of speed and selectivity of protection principle have become two key issues that need to be addressed in flexible DC grid .

"Interpretation of these results is a little tenuous , being circumscribed not only by the different geometries but also by the fact that the FP unit does not perform division . The 65 nm Modified Chester arrangement performs an addition or direct subtraction with 55 percent of the delay of the 45 nm FP unit in col . 1 , and a co-transformed subtraction with 118 percent of this delay . Using the weighted average described above , a mixture of direct and co-transformed subtractions will complete with 58 percent of the FP delay . Multiplications are about 14 times faster . With a reduction to 45 nm fabrication , these speeds could only improve . The LNS design does occupy almost three times the area of the FP unit , but applying a 50 percent reduction as one moves from 65 to 45 nm , it would become 1.5 times the size . The comparison would then have to account for the assumed size of an FP division unit . If this were taken to be , say 25 percent of that of the adder and multiplier , then this LNS design might occupy 1.2 times the area of the FP unit .

"The backpressure scheduling scheme has been applied in Internet of Things , which can control the network congestion effectively and increase the network throughput . However , in large - scale Emergency Internet of Things ( EIoT ) , emergency packets may exist because of the urgent events or situations . The traditional backpressure scheduling scheme will explore all the possible routes between the source and destination nodes that cause a superfluous long path for packets . Therefore , the end - to - end delay increases and the real - time performance of emergency packets cannot be guaranteed . To address this shortcoming , this paper proposes EABS , an event - aware backpressure scheduling scheme for EIoT . A backpressure queue model with emergency packets is first devised based on the analysis of the arrival process of different packets . Meanwhile , EABS combines the shortest path with backpressure scheme in the process of next- hop node selecting . The emergency packets are forwarded in the shortest path and avoid the network congestion according to the queue backlog difference . The extensive experiment results verify that EABS can reduce the average end - to - end delay and increase the average forwarding percentage . For the emergency packets , the real - time performance is guaranteed . Moreover , we compare EABS with two existing backpressure scheduling schemes , showing that EABS outperforms both of them .",The emergency packets,161,164,the network throughput,21,24,The emergency packets do not decrease the network throughputin the proposed method.

"In the way circuit Z2 benefits from redundancy , it may appear contradictory that circuit Z0 , featuring the maximum amount of redundancy , does not . In fact for the majority of cases , fault recovery is much less successful on Z0 than any of the other circuits . The reason for this is likely down to the method of fault injection .

"Despite the limitations , the value of this study lies in the effort to empirically test format effects by taking a componential approach to reading . This study has tried to answer the question of whether the role of sub-reading skills varies systematically depending on the test format . A related but separated question would be how the role of sub-reading skills differs depending on the test format . In this respect , the predictive regression based on the data-driven model adopted in this study provided reliable evidence that format effects in L2 reading do exist , as sub-reading components play different roles in each format . Although it will never substitute for full - scale componential analysis or in - depth qualitative investigations of test takers ' thought processes , the predictive regression results can still contribute to forming a consensus on the "" big picture , "" which can be a valuable set of empirical facts that should be matched and explained by subsequent large - scale , in - depth research projects . Future studies with more emphasis on the how question are therefore suggested . Further research should be undertaken to explore the underlying structure of the reading construct being tested in MC and OE tests , to identify the determinants of each construct , and to inspect test takers ' cognition during a test .

"A pipeline is a set of processes that are linearly connected so that the output of one is delivered as input to the next one in the series . While the concept 's origin in the form used today was popularized by the Unix operating system , pipelines are nowadays supported by many modern systems . The availability of pipelines has allowed the development of toolkits that build on them and the emergence of the "" pipes and filters "" architecture . Although pipelines are extremely powerful , the standard Unix shell 's restriction of the supported topology to a linear sequence , limits the structure or performance of many useful applications that require a more general way to interconnect processes .

This pattern demonstrated that this subdiscipline considered explaining the significance of research and promoting further research to be as important as reporting and interpreting a study . Engineering research is often considered to be practically oriented , with the focus on the process of achieving certain objectives or making materials or products ( the how ) rather than trying to understand the why . Therefore , it can be said that traditional subdisciplines such as structural engineering do not use many of the steps for '' Move : Explaining specific research outcomes '' by indicating significance , contrasting present and previous outcomes , and indicating limitations of outcomes .",it,107,108,further research,55,57,It can be said that this subdiscipline promotes further research.
"According to ACDH hypothesis , verbal ( event ) passives with syntactic movement will be more difficult for young children to understand than adjectival ( state ) passives which are without movement , leading to the prediction that Mandarin-speaking children should better understand state passives than event passives . This study is a further exploration of adjectival ( state ) passives in this field . Firstly , this paper extended the research scope to Mandarin event and state passives in order to provide more evidence for the universality of passive development sequence . English is one kind of language which is marked by a wealth of morphological changes , while Chinese is marked by few morphological changes . By comparing two kinds of passive structures in different languages , people can have a better knowledge of passive sentence structure in different types of languages . For passive sentences in English , there always exist argument movements in long passives or short ones . While in Chinese , only short passive sentences involve argument movement . By studying the acquisition of event and state passives by Mandarin-speaking children , we can enrich our knowledge about passive structures in different languages . Secondly , the influence of verb types were also taken into consideration so that to provide a more comprehensive study of event and state passives by Mandarin-speaking children . The aims of the present study are to investigate the development of children 's comprehension of event and state passives in Mandarin , and whether , and at what age , they can distinguish these two types of passives .",this paper,67,69,our knowledge,191,193,This paper can enrich our knowledge about passive structures in different languages.
"Starting with the latter aspects , one of the uncertainties arising in the combination of experimental and numerical representations of an open-cell porous foam is the question of the surface boundary itself , where the displacement fields are observed . As discussed above , the experimental data used in the present work is acquired using DIC , and depending on the pore structure close to the surface , these data might consist of more or less representative averages of the actual displacement fields . This in itself touches upon one of the fundamental questions related to homogenisation and its validity at a boundary , which will be treated in upcoming works . But it also raises a point related to the sensitivity of the chosen cost function , to this ambiguity of the observation data . In the characterisation of a real , industrial open- cell foam , there are a number of uncertainties affecting the modelling assumptions that need to be made . Examples of such aspects are e.g. a polydisperse cell structure , orientation of the cells which might vary with the sample and where it has been extracted out of a larger foam slab , variations in the microstructure related to geometry , shape , connections , etc . While all these are relevant to take into account when the equivalent model is used in an engineering application , they obscure some of the more fundamental aspects related to the inverse estimation that need to be addressed .",the present work,49,52,a point,116,118,The present work raises the sensitivity of the chosen cost function as a point.

"The work reported here has focussed on establishing the basic components from which descriptions of complex design practice can be constructed . A longer term endeavour would be to determine which complex design profiles are most common , i.e. which elements of the framework tend to occur together and whether there are trends in the ways complex design problems and practices are described in different contexts . It might then also be possible to relate such trends to specific features of the design context , such as the nature of the system entities ( whether they are material components , people , processes organisations , or some combination of these ) or the domains drawn from when addressing them ( e.g. biology , physics , sociology , psychology ) . Identifying such associations would provide the basis for matching complex design practices with the types of design problems they are best suited for , even when these design practices come from domains or contexts that are not obviously related to the problem at hand . In doing so , different complex design fields could be improved by learning from each other with respect to those practices that can be meaningfully shared between fields despite superficial differences .",A longer term,22,25,different complex design fields,179,183,A longer term endeavour will improve different complex design fields.
"From the microstructural investigation in Section 4.1 , it is evident that the precipitate structure is markedly influenced by the quench rate . A slower quench rate , i.e. , cooling , gives a reduced volume fraction of strengthening precipitates within the grains , and wider PFZs at the grain boundaries and around the dispersoids . The influence of quench rate on the number density , cross-sectional area and length of the precipitates depends on the alloy . The lean 6060 alloy has a lower number density of precipitates after air - cooling and the precipitates have a larger area and length . The air - cooling is detrimental to the precipitate structure of the 6082.25 alloy , which has a fibrous grain structure with flat , elongated grains and small , and results in an inhomogeneous microstructure where entire grains are free of strengthening precipitates . Precipitation in the 6082.50 alloy also becomes inhomogeneous after air - cooling , consisting of strong regions with dense precipitation resembling the water - quenched state and relatively large soft regions around dispersoids ( due to PFZs around dispersoids ) .",the 6082.50 alloy,149,152,precipitate structure,13,15,the 6082.50 alloy contains an inhomogeneous precipitate structure.

"In the previous section we showed the inconsistency of the nonlocal strain gradient theory when applied to bounded solids . The drawback has been extensively exemplified by the study of a 1D elastostatic problem : a Euler beam submitted to axial and transverse loads . The solution of this problem has to satisfy three kinds of boundary conditions : standard , non-standard and constitutive . The standard and non-standard boundary conditions come from the application of Principle of Minimum Total Potential Energy and they are necessary to fulfil equilibrium . The non-standard ones are a consequence of the consideration of the strain gradient field in the formulation of the model . The constitutive boundary conditions arise from the integral character of the constitutive equations , and they have also to be accomplished . Therefore , as it has been presented in the previous sections , the studied problem is ill- posed since the number of boundary conditions is higher than the order of the differential operator . In this section we discuss the consistency of other nonlocal elastic theories which also use the constitutive equations in integral form , namely , a ) nonlocal strain - driven elasticity ; two - phase local / non - local strain - driven elasticity ; ) nonlocal stress - driven elasticity ; d) two - phase local / non - local stress - driven elasticity .",this problem,48,50,the differential operator,163,166,This problem is ill-posed since the number of boundary conditions is higher than the oder of the differential operator.

"Within doctors ' surgeries , power differences between consumers and general practitioners or medical specialists are less pronounced than in the hospital setting .

"Capital good firms are confronted with very specific challenges and have specific characteristics that make them a unique class of firms . They typically manage programs of projects in which the issue of engineering change cannot be viewed from the perspective of an individual delivery , but at the program level , making engineering change management considerably more difficult compared to one - off projects . This also fundamentally distinguishes this type of firm from those working on a mass production or mass customization basis . In these cases designs are either frozen before entering production or the product has built - in variety parameters . In either case engineering change would be easier to manage , and the effect of engineering change on design and process variety would be limited . The framework of archetypes recognizes that there is no such thing as a typical capital good firm , but that there exist different configurations . We discuss our findings in light of three issues : ( 1 ) generalizability of the framework to the entire capital good sector , ( 2 ) the role of the environment and ( 3 ) the notion of complexity . An important question concerns the generalizability of the archetypes framework to other firms in the capital good sector . Our results apply to a broad class of capital good firms . This class is mainly characterized by the existence of a portfolio of products . Firms having multiple products in a portfolio typically look for ways to reuse design information from one order to the other , and they attempt to do so using as much process standardization as possible . This makes our results less applicable for firms working on a strict one - off basis . Although the firms in our study also govern the use and maintenance phases of the capital good lifecycle , our results are not necessarily limited to this class . Use and maintenance phases can be an important source of engineering change , can be important phases in which engineering changes are executed and can also be important lifecycle processes in which variety management ( in terms of both design variety and process variety ) plays a role . However , our framework would also apply to firms that only govern the lifecycle phases of the delivery of the capital good to the client .",they,266,267,the issue,30,32,They typically manage the issue.

"velocity was found to be an effective way to both lower chip temperature and increase FCA power generation . However due to a stronger dependence on the flow velocity , the related increase in pumping power outweighs the power generation gain when flow velocity reaches a certain critical value . The maximum flow velocity in our simulations was 2.5 for channels 100 mm high and 50 mm wide , restricted by the aforementioned pressure drop constraint , which is still lower than the critical velocity . For channels with larger , hydraulic resistance is lower , and flow velocity can exceed either the critical value or the laminar flow constraints before the corresponded pressure drop reaches its limit . Finally , inlet temperature can also be increased to maximize FCA power generation , accepting a trade - off with the maximum chip temperature . However , the leakage power rise due to the higher MPU temperature outweighs the FCA power generation increase . Therefore , given the current 22 nm MPU architecture under analysis , it seems reasonable to keep the inlet temperature low for this specific simulation scenario . On the other hand , note that elevated fluid temperatures are beneficial in terms of heat rejection to ambient , and by allowing free cooling at the facility level , an overall energetic benefit in the case of higher inlet temperatures is still likely to be incurred .",The maximum flow velocity,50,54,the related increase,30,33,The maximum flow velocity causes the related increase the related increase in pumping power.

"In comparative constructions , French nominative pronouns can also occur at the end of the construction in their stressed form . The French comparative construction is similar to that of English , but the comparative conjunction que can never be considered as a preposition . For example , it is obvious that me in ( 14b ) is not accusative because there is only one clausal element as comparee , that is , the subject , in the matrix clause . According to the above analysis , it can be concluded that the stressed personal pronoun can be used as a substitute for the nominative personal pronoun at the position of the information focus in the accusative form in English . In this case , the comparative construction itself has not changed structurally at all . The conjunction than has not changed into a preposition ; it still introduces an ellipical comparative clause . In you are taller than I and You are taller than me , the comparees of I and me are both you in the matrix clause , but me here is not an accusative pronoun ; rather it is a stressed personal pronoun . When there is no ambiguity , than me is the unmarked choice and than I , the marked choice . The concepts of unmarkedness and markedness reflect the basic idea of probability . The choice between nominative pronouns and accusative pronouns following than is not that between correctness and wrongness . They both are features of a system , one being higher probability and the other lower . When there are two arguments in the matrix clause and the personal pronoun following than is compared with the subject of the matrix clause , the unmarked form is the nominative pronoun plus an auxiliary verb . The function of the auxiliary verb is to avoid the nominative personal pronoun with no specific meaning occurring at the position of information focus and to avoid the possible ambiguity caused by an accusative pronoun . When the personal pronoun is compared with the object of the matrix clause , the accusative form is the only choice . In English , it is unmarked to end a sentence with an accusative pronoun . If there is only one possible comparee , the nominative pronoun plus an auxiliary verb is grammatically acceptable , but it is too formal and not concise , but if there is not an auxiliary verb , it will break the principle of . So the best choice is to use the stressed personal pronoun . This fulfills both the principle of conciseness and that of information focus . No matter whether in formal or in informal texts , it is marked to end a comparative construction with a nominative pronoun . Since markedness does not affect the grammaticality , we do sometimes observe nominative personal pronouns ending a comparative construction , even though the probability is relatively low . Therefore , it is not necessary to change the syntactic structure for an awkward explanation .",unmarkedness,221,222,information focus,112,114,no relation found

"This study was concerned with representing the functional product architecture ( physical organisations of parts in a component to satisfy the functions ) for an integrated product considering alternative manufacturing options . For integrated products , conventional architecture representations such as DSMs ( Design Structure Matrices ) or node link diagrams are insufficient in indicating how the product satisfies the functions required of it since the matrices have only one element in it , as is the case when using a fully integrated component such as a complex casting . To solve the representation problem , it was proposed that each manufactured segment of the product ( such as a cast segment ) be associated with a generalised function and a generalised section . Generalised functions ( GFs ) are the collection of all functions that a class of products are typically required to satisfy . Generalised sections ( GSs ) are the collection of all regions present in different products that contribute to satisfying the functions . Since the same manufactured segment of the product is associated with generalised functions and generalised sections , a GF - GS mapping can be created from a set composition operation and represented in a graph . The GFs and GSs form the nodes and relations between GSs and GFs form the edges of the graph . In addition to the approach that associates manufactured segments to GFs and GSs , an enhanced function - means ( EF - M ) tree for the components was created so that already existing design knowledge can be included in the architecture representation . Graphs can then be generated from the axiomatic design matrix ( iibmatrix ) for the EF - tree which is similar to the initially created graph but with more refined functions to sections to relationships in it .",addition,225,226,the nodes,209,211,"In addition, the GFs and GSs form the nodes."
"The finding that both student groups strikingly differ from the two scholar groups in LGMs suggest that genre , knowledge and experience in academic writing developed out of disciplinary learning is more important than their native speaker status , as the scholar groups include both English L1 and L2 scholars .

"We develop a new effective mathematical formulation and resulting universal computational algorithm capable of tackling various HF models in the framework of a unified approach . The scheme is not limited to any particular elasticity operator or crack propagation regime . Its basic assumptions are : ( i ) proper choice of independent and dependent variables ( with the direct utilization of a new one - the reduced particle velocity ) , ( ii ) tracing the fracture front by use of the Stefan condition ( speed equation ) , which can be integrated in closed form and provides an explicit relation between the crack propagation speed and the coefficients in the asymptotic expansion of the crack opening , ( iii ) proper regularization techniques , ( iv ) improved temporal approximation , ( ) modular algorithm architecture . The application of the new dependent variable , the reduced particle velocity , instead of the usual fluid flow rate , facilitates the computation of the crack propagation speed from the local relation based on the speed equation . This way , we avoid numerical evaluation of the undetermined limit of the product of fracture aperture and pressure gradient at the crack tip ( or alternatively the limit resulting from ratio of the fluid flow rate and the crack opening ) , which always poses a considerable computational challenge . As a result , the position of the crack front is accurately determined from an explicit formula derived from the speed equation . This approach leads to a robust numerical scheme . Its performance is demonstrated using classical examples of 1 models for hydraulic fracturing : PKN and KGD models under various fracture propagation regimes . Solution accuracy is verified against dedicated analytical benchmarks and other solutions available in the literature .

"A novel concept of self contained actuators unit in wide area control of damping in power system for nominal system condition under different operating points as well as for system affected by actuator faults is presented in the paper . A wide area robust damping controller is designed to meet multiple objectives from disturbance attenuation to ensuring minimum damping in system . Infinity norm minimization of closed loop transfer function and pole placement criterion is used in the design of wide area robust damping controller . The use of multiple output wide area controller feeding multiple actuators in power system allows for higher damping and fast settling of power oscillations in system . The wide area damping controller is tested for different operating conditions and controller is found suitable in providing sufficient damping in system compared to open loop system . The reconfigurable control design following fault hiding principle that is added to wide area controller is found to maintain sufficient system damping on actuator faults taking place in system . The reconfiguration component is activated on actuator fault and together with remaining active actuators from the same group ( earlier to actuator fault ) stabilizes system response . The group of actuators involved in wide area control and damping act as an self sufficient actuators unit for maintaining system damping and preserving system response even in the case of actuator faults . The reconfiguration component is dynamic and assumes parameters that changes with respect to change in actuator fault but together with remaining active actuators act to maintain system damping level to pre-fault condition . On actuator fault wide area control signal is redistributed to the remaining active actuators by the reconfiguration component . A two area power system model is considered for implementing the proposed methods of designing ( i ) robust wide area damping controller and ( ii ) reconfiguration component to test their effectiveness in damping control . The results obtained show that reconfigurable control design for wide area damping controller having multiple outputs makes for an self contained actuators unit capable to maintain sufficient damping in system with or without actuator fault , under different operating points and independent of use of any redundant actuators .",The wide area,113,116,actuator fault,177,179,no relation found

"Design disjunction realizes a set of f-disjunct DCs , each of which implements the same application functionality , and then employs them to locate and evade defective resources during system lifetime while maintaining optimal availability . These DCs are produced prior to the test procedure ; therefore , only partial reconfiguration overhead of existing DCs is incurred during fault diagnosis and recovery . Fault tolerance is achieved by run-time reconfiguration to load one of the bitfiles from the subset of DCs which does not utilize defective resources . The constructive property of is shown to be effective for extracting highly fault - resilient DCs against logic and interconnect failures . In this work , FPGA - based fault scenarios are considered for evaluation of design disjunction since FPGAs are the prominent form of contemporary reconfigurable hardware . Modern FPGAs have multiple levels of logic cell granularity . For instance , basic logic elements such as LUTs and of Xilinx FPGAs are organized into logic slices which are considered the most primitive programmable logic blocks . As such , design disjunction is examined at the slice level . Thus , the columns of the design matrix correspond to slices while rows represent DCs .

"All concrete cubes have shown a general trend of increasing their masses with increasing the applied number of cycles , with different performance for each mix . This increase in mass is attributed to the absorption of concrete to moisture from the surrounding environment due to the applied humidity of 60 during the test . Water is believed to be absorbed through the pore structure of concrete during the thawing process . When the freezing phase starts , the absorbed water will freeze inside the pores and expands , which will create some microcracks inside the pore structure . These cracks will increase the absorption of concrete to moisture and participate in increasing the mass . During all the cycles , concrete with low ratio ( 0.32 and 0.37 ) has gained less weight than concrete with high ratio ( 0.40 and 0.46 ) .",This increase,27,29,the test,52,54,This increase in mass is attributed to the absorption of concrete to moisture from the surrounding environment due to the applied humidity of 60 during the test.

"The application of variable stretching body to engineering problem may happen to a greater extent than a flat body . The speed of a variable stretching body , at different positions , depends on the stretching body material , the body thickness can change with the motion of the body . For instant , if the stretching speed is linearly proportional to the distance from a specified position , a linear decrease occurs in the body thickness with the distance . The stretching disk with variable thickness can be more relevant to the practical situation .

However , these two goals might not always be in harmony . If we try to provide the highest quality of service ( e.g. , using the most robust cryptographic solution ) , it may result in some flows not being serviced within the required delay constraint . So , we have to find a balance between the quality of service that can be provided and the number of flows that can be serviced with priorities based on their severities . Thus , we formulate this problem as a Penalized Multiple Knapsack Problem ( PMKP ) with the goal of maximizing the profit ( i.e. , the total severity of the admitted flows ) .

"We start with a parallelism with entrepreneurship , that finance scholars historically considered as a separate field . The implicit idea was that the issues in entrepreneurial finance are different from those faced by public corporations so as to limit the applicability of traditional finance theory . On the one hand , entrepreneurial finance primarily refers to early stage financing mechanisms , often supplied by the entrepreneur 's personal network as a consequence of her inability to fully access the public market . On the other hand , corporate finance literature tends to focus on publicly traded firms as the main unit of analysis . However , the evolution of both the real economy and academic research has made clear that this is no longer the case . Financial scholars have indeed recognized that agency problems and information asymmetries , that are the basis of corporate finance and financial economics , are actually the two fundamental issues in entrepreneurial finance . In the entrepreneurial setting , information asymmetry is particularly pronounced due to the difficulty faced by entrepreneurs in conveying the quality of their new ventures to firm outsiders , resulting in potentially severe agency issues .

For example , while we demonstrated preliminary reliability for the reporting of both quantity and frequency across multiple forms of substances , the differences between the online and in - person measures for nicotine / tobacco total days and alcohol total drinks were significantly different . This could be due to the fact that use in our sample was notably limited , though it should be noted that the actual differences were small and do not appear to be clinically meaningful and could benefit from further validation among community or clinical samples . Also , while our measure demonstrated reliable reporting of days and amounts used for different modes of cannabis administration , such as flower , edibles , and concentrates , the majority of participants interestingly did not report on the specific THC or CBD contents of their cannabis as demonstrated by our ancillary findings . This limitation could be due to our reliance on a sample that was on average below the legal age for purchasing and using cannabis ( 21 ) , and thus more likely to use cannabis in groups socially where potency is not known by users .

"The present work shows the inconsistency of the nonlocal strain gradient elasticity theory when applied to bounded solids . The reason lies in the impossibility of fulfilling three types of boundary conditions at once : standard , non-standard , and constitutive . This limitation has been exemplified with the static axial and bending behaviour of Bernoulli-Euler beams . The elastostatic problem has been formulated using the Principle of Minimum Total Potential Energy , which leads to the differential governing equation as well as to the corresponding standard and non-standard boundary conditions that are necessary to fulfil equilibrium . Moreover , two additional constitutive boundary conditions , which are inherent to the formulation of the constitutive equation through convolution integrals , have to be satisfied as other authors have pointed out . The problem is formulated in terms of displacements leading , in the axial case , to a fourth - order ODE with six boundary conditions and , in the bending case , to a sixth-order ODE with eight boundary conditions , all of them being mandatory . Therefore the problem becomes ill- posed and has no solution in general . The inconsistency is evidenced through three examples with different loads and boundary conditions . In all of them , the displacement fields , obtained from the governing equation and fulfilling standard and constitutive boundary conditions , are not compatible with equilibrium since the non-standard boundary conditions are not satisfied by these solutions .",convolution integrals,117,119,Bernoulli-Euler beams,55,57,no relation found

The group of actuators involved in damping of oscillations in wide area control act as a self independent unit for different operating conditions of nominal system as well as for system with actuator faults . The unit is even effective for damping of power oscillations even when one or more actuators goes off and the number of active actuators is reduced . Reconfigurable control is added to the design of WRDC where a reconfiguration component ( RC ) is embedded in the feedback path of the controller . RC is designed along the lines of fault hiding principle and is activated only on occurrence of actuator fault . On activation RC connects to remaining active actuators and together make - up for loss of control action due to actuator faults . RC redistributes control effort among the active actuators to meet system performance objectives . Hence no redundant actuator is required post actuator fault to transfer control to prevent system performance from deteriorating . The multiple actuators involved in WAC of power system under reconfigurable control acts as one self contained unit capable to keep system response unaffected from any actuator faults . With fault hiding principle based reconfigurable control the RC acts as virtual actuator on occurrence of actuator fault . Under the proposed fault tolerant control design nominal wide area damping controller ( WRDC ) can be used without any changes to its parameter .

"In this paper , a new multi-objective optimization problem for microgrid energy management is formulated as MILP in GAMS environment . Energy dispatch and techno-economic analysis has been presented for standalone and grid connected microgrids with hybrid energy sources and storage devices . Capital cost , operational cost , fuel cost , cost of energy , emission penalty and total cost are determined for the test system . From the simulation results it is observed that fuel cost of diesel generator and micro turbines has significant impact on cost of energy . The presence of the energy storage system in the microgrid , raises the complexity of solving the energy management problem , and increases the time and computational burden of optimization algorithms . Therefore , in this paper , the fuzzy inference system is used to decide on the amount of charging and discharging power of the storage system in MGEM problem solving . The results confirm the effectiveness of using such a system in the MGEM optimizing . Simulation results obtained with the proposed method is compared with various evolutionary algorithms to verify it 's effectiveness . In this study , demand response programs were integrated into the energy management system for better operation of microgrids . Accordingly , the impact of different demand response programs on optimal energy dispatch , technoeconomic and environment benefit has been investigated .

"This work contributed a notion of non-stationary service curves that enables the analysis of transient phases . We contributed models of systems with sleep scheduling and provided insights into their transient behavior . Further , we considered measurement - based methods for identification of systems , using a black - box model . We discovered that existing probing methods cannot accurately estimate non-stationary service curves . The difficulties were related to the non-convexity and of the service . We devised a novel two - phase probing method . First a minimal probe is estimated that is adapted to the network . In a second step , the minimal probe is used to obtain a service curve estimate with a defined accuracy . Taking advantage of the estimation method , we reported results from a comprehensive measurement study of cellular networks with sleep scheduling , including EDGE , HSPA , and LTE . The service curve estimates showed characteristic features of the cellular data service that explained the observation of significant transient overshoots and long relaxation times . While delays in the range of seconds have been measured for EDGE and HSPA , it has been found that LTE achieves an improvement by an order of magnitude .

"The role of quench rate after the solution treatment on the plastic flow and fracture of three aluminium alloys was studied by conducting tensile tests on smooth and V-notched specimens as well as Kahn tear tests . The three AlMgSi alloys considered , i.e. , 6060 , 6082.25 and 6082.50 , had different grain structure , grain size and crystallographic texture . The alloys were differently affected by the quench rate , as obtained by water - quenching or air . The TEM study showed that air - cooling is detrimental for precipitation in all alloys . In lean alloys , like the 6060 alloy , the detrimental effect is due to an overall reduction in precipitate number density and slightly coarser precipitates . In dense alloys that contain dispersoids , like the 6082 alloys , PFZs around the dispersoids become much wider after air . If the density of dispersoids is high and the grain size is small , such as in the 6082.25 alloy , the PFZs of adjacent dispersoids overlap , and due to the small grain and subgrain size in this material , entire grains can become free of precipitates . If the density of dispersoids is low and the grain size is relatively large , as in the 6082.50 alloy , PFZs around dispersoids do not necessarily overlap , resulting in an inhomogenous microstructure consisting of strong regions of dense preciptiation a certain distance from dispersoids that are surrounded by wide PFZs . gave consistently larger precipitate free zones around both GBs and dispersoids in the three alloys than water - quenching .",The role,0,2,PFZs,136,137,The role of quench rate affected the PFZs in dense alloys.

"In conclusion , this paper , following a brief introduction of how the CEFR has influenced the teaching practices and language policies in China since its publication , gives an overview of the Chinese context which calls for a featured and practical framework for language teaching , learning and assessment . The article then discusses in detail the principles we have followed and the steps involved in developing the listening ability scales . As with the CEFR , the language ability model is based on CLA , but there is some difference . Language ability is put into the big picture of cognitive ability in our model , thus more attention is given to the language processing stage , although it has proved to be difficult to operationalize this model . In the descriptor collecting and scaling process , we have taken full advantage of research resources and managed to ensure the coverage and representativeness of the data . In the last part , some issues or problems we 've encountered so far are identified and discussed . The outcome of the project may probably be far from flawless , follow - up research and revision should continue as the scales are put into use .",some issues,164,166,assessment,49,50,no relation found

"This study investigated how different modes of peer review affect the commenting patterns and revisions among L2 writers . Some considerations should be made while comparing FFPR and MMPR modes : ( 1 ) the findings of the present study confirmed that the number of overall comments and the percentage of revision-oriented comments made by mobile - mediated peer review mode was larger , consequently , resulting in a larger number of revisions . Thus , it is suggested that making peer comments with the use of mobile applications is effective in developing academic writing skills . ( 2 ) Although the use of mobile applications resulted in a more efficient peer review practice , the FFPR has its own advantages . Approaching peer review from both modes will provide researchers with an overall understanding of group dynamics and expectations . The act of peer review will be more influential when combined with either face - to - face or asynchronous and either FFPR , CMPR , or MMPR modes of communication which encourages students to generate more focused , deliberate peer comments . ( 3 ) Language teachers should encourage interaction exchanges not only in learning environments but in social spaces , especially in CMPR and MMPR .

"From the microstructural investigation in Section 4.1 , it is evident that the precipitate structure is markedly influenced by the quench rate . A slower quench rate , i.e. , cooling , gives a reduced volume fraction of strengthening precipitates within the grains , and wider PFZs at the grain boundaries and around the dispersoids . The influence of quench rate on the number density , cross-sectional area and length of the precipitates depends on the alloy . The lean 6060 alloy has a lower number density of precipitates after air - cooling and the precipitates have a larger area and length . The air - cooling is detrimental to the precipitate structure of the 6082.25 alloy , which has a fibrous grain structure with flat , elongated grains and small , and results in an inhomogeneous microstructure where entire grains are free of strengthening precipitates . Precipitation in the 6082.50 alloy also becomes inhomogeneous after air - cooling , consisting of strong regions with dense precipitation resembling the water - quenched state and relatively large soft regions around dispersoids ( due to PFZs around dispersoids ) .",the microstructural investigation,1,4,dispersoids,54,55,the microstructural investigation found wider PFZs around the dispersoids.

"Within manufacturing companies , the architectural description of how a product is built is typically well defined while the architecture of the product from a functional view describing how the functional requirements are met in the product is often less articulated . For products composed of many components ( modular products ) such descriptions are clear , whereas few representation schemes are available that treat highly functionally integrated components , where all the functions are satisfied by one integral , homogenous physical structure . In this paper , an approach to describe the architecture for integrated components in the aerospace industry is described . Different regions of the component , termed as sections , are assumed to satisfy the functions required of the structure which are often manufactured by joining ( welding ) different segments . By assigning sectional and functional information to different manufactured segments of the structure , graphs are created that link the functional requirements and sections . Two different methods , one based on set compositions and other on creating an enhanced function - means ( EF - M ) tree are used to link the functions to the sections of the component , resulting in different graphs for different types of manufacturing splits for the same component . Comparison of the methods is then carried out using properties of the graphs produced . The method that utilises set compositions performs well for entire component descriptions while the method that uses an EF - tree to create a graph describes sections ( regions ) of the component well so that functional relationships can be better described ( integration of already existing design knowledge ) . The product descriptions created can help designers to identify how alternative manufacturing splits impact the functionally defined product architecture which in turn enables both improved manufacturing and improved design decisions .",different graphs,200,202,functional relationships,264,266,Different graphs describes sections (regions) of the component well so as to describe functional relationships.

In addition , polymersomes loaded with catalytic compounds , such as enzymes , play the role of AOs and support in situ reactions inside MFs . Compared to previously reported artificial cells based on bottom - up approaches , our MFs represent an advance in terms of complexity ( given by the intrinsic composition of GPMVs supplemented by transfer ) and functionality ( supported by in situ enzymatic reactions inside AOs ) that has been proven in vivo .

"The qualitative examinations supplemented the findings from our quantitative examination and demonstrated the potential of the overall quality dimension . Ideally , all the five dimensions of our rubric should be employed because of their high reliability ; however , in educational contexts , the use of the overall quality dimension is a valid option . For example , the overall quality dimension can be used alone as a holistic assessment , depending on the purpose of the assessment and teaching in individual teaching contexts . In other words , if only holistic assessment results are needed , teacher raters might use this dimension exclusively ; if they can conduct both holistic and analytic assessments , that is preferable . It should be noted that when the overall quality dimension is used alone for the assessment of students ' L2 summaries , teacher raters should review and understand the other four dimensions and their descriptors in advance . Nevertheless , we do not exclude the usage of the four-dimensional rubric alone as a rigid and independent analytic assessment .

"Obviously , in order to meet the required functionality set forth , the inversion should ultimately be able to identify a symmetric KC model , with an isotropic equivalent model , even when the optimisation is performed using a full ( 21 moduli ) anisotropic constitutive model .

However , any individual deviations from the typical behavior , for example , due to weather or changes in food availability will result in a suboptimal GPS sampling strategy . This strategy is used by many commercial motion - based GPS trackers that operate at a fixed GPS duty cycle .",weather,111,112,the energy budget,54,57,no relation found

"The influence of the particle size and packing on the overall elastic-plastic properties of metal- matrix composites has been analyzed . The field Morphologically Representative Pattern ( MRP ) approach , originally developed to address linear material behaviour , has been adapted to account for non-linearity . Within the proposed MRP formulation , a particulate composite microstructure has been represented by two patterns : one with a spherical inclusion surrounded by a layer having a thickness defined by the mean minimum distance between particles in the representative volume , and the second one carrying the remaining pure matrix material . Both patterns are embedded in a homogenized effective medium . The mean minimum distance parameter describes the packing ( clustering ) of the particles .

"To understand how the chain works , we can first think of it as an exponent sorter . On each cycle , two neighbors are compared . If they are in the appropriate order , the exponent of the value in the smaller position is larger than the exponent of the value in the larger position : they remain in the same position . If they are out of order , the positions are swapped to place them in order . The two stages guarantee that each cycle through the distill chain will compare each value with its left and right neighbors , allowing it to move one position to the left or right in each cycle . If the elements are properly ordered , then no values change positions in a cycle . In the worst case , a value moves from one end of the chain to the other , a total of positions . Now consider the FPART units instead of sort units . On each cycle , we add two floating - point values . If the values do not overlap , the FPART simply sorts the values by the exponent . When the values overlap , the FPART adds the values and the sum output , s , has a larger exponent than the residue output , r , so the outputs are also in sorted order . However , unlike a sorter , the values that come out can be very different from the ones that went in . Due to cancellation , they could both have smaller exponents . When the signs of the values are the same , we can end up with a larger exponent for the s output and a smaller one for Either case may leave the results unsorted within the distill chain . However , if we continue to cycle the chain , the values will be moved to their proper position where they will potentially interact to produce a new sum and residue .",a sorter,236,238,it,12,13,no relation found

"We have drawn attention to the fact that Cesaro 's representation can be applied in order to integrate , for a given stretching tensor field , the stretching gradient relation in continuum mechanics . If the stretching tensor field does not satisfy the compatibility requirements for application of the Cesaro representation , then the corresponding flow field is multi-valued and it would be classified as ' incompatible ' . This characterization of incompatible flows appears to have gone unnoticed in classical fluid mechanics , probably because the dynamical equations of motion for a fluid are traditionally expressed directly in terms of the velocity field , so that the stretching tensor field , as well as the vorticity tensor field , is directly generated by differentiation . Nevertheless , if , for high Reynolds number flows , say , the stretching tensor field fails to satisfy the appropriate compatibility conditions in some region of the flow domain , it follows from our results that the associated velocity field in that region will not be single - valued , and in that region it will suffer discontinuities , such as local slips possibly producing a field of vortex sheets . To our knowledge , the issue of compatibility in fluid mechanics has gone unnoticed and un-investigated in the literature relating to turbulence where , instead , such an issue seems relevant . Any serious connection between the onset of turbulence and incompatible flows as described herein has yet to be explored .",our knowledge,199,201,flow field,55,57,no relation found

"A novel concept of self contained actuators unit in wide area control of damping in power system for nominal system condition under different operating points as well as for system affected by actuator faults is presented in the paper . A wide area robust damping controller is designed to meet multiple objectives from disturbance attenuation to ensuring minimum damping in system . Infinity norm minimization of closed loop transfer function and pole placement criterion is used in the design of wide area robust damping controller . The use of multiple output wide area controller feeding multiple actuators in power system allows for higher damping and fast settling of power oscillations in system . The wide area damping controller is tested for different operating conditions and controller is found suitable in providing sufficient damping in system compared to open loop system . The reconfigurable control design following fault hiding principle that is added to wide area controller is found to maintain sufficient system damping on actuator faults taking place in system . The reconfiguration component is activated on actuator fault and together with remaining active actuators from the same group ( earlier to actuator fault ) stabilizes system response . The group of actuators involved in wide area control and damping act as an self sufficient actuators unit for maintaining system damping and preserving system response even in the case of actuator faults . The reconfiguration component is dynamic and assumes parameters that changes with respect to change in actuator fault but together with remaining active actuators act to maintain system damping level to pre-fault condition . On actuator fault wide area control signal is redistributed to the remaining active actuators by the reconfiguration component . A two area power system model is considered for implementing the proposed methods of designing ( i ) robust wide area damping controller and ( ii ) reconfiguration component to test their effectiveness in damping control . The results obtained show that reconfigurable control design for wide area damping controller having multiple outputs makes for an self contained actuators unit capable to maintain sufficient damping in system with or without actuator fault , under different operating points and independent of use of any redundant actuators .",controller,45,46,wide area,9,11,The controller is designed to have wide area.

However , we have not tested the method in a homogeneous group and compared the results to be able to verify these implications .

If the participants of a group have a similar background , competence and perspective with respect to the ideation topic , it is expected that the ideas that the group can produce at the start of the method will have less variety and hence not serve the purpose of functioning as stimulus ideas for the group .

"In both datasets , Oracle performs better than the PC , which can be explained by two reasons . First , the Oracle takes decisions every second as opposed to every five seconds in PC . Second , when choosing the nominated server in PC on a round - robin basis , due to the partial connectivity , not all the nodes can communicate with the server which results in slightly degraded performance ( see Section 6.5 ) . However , PC is still superior than the distributed algorithms . Regarding energy consumption , in the RWP case , the centralised algorithms actually consumed less energy than the NO case .

"Due to the tightening of requirements and the increasing complexity of products , robust design becomes more and more important in the context of a straightforward product development . Although various robust design methods have been evolved to support the design of products that are less sensitive to variations , these methods are not sufficiently integrated into early stages of the product development process . This is mainly due to the lack of concrete product data necessary for robustness evaluation and tolerance specification . For this reason , it is still unclear to product development engineers when and how to apply existing approaches for enhancing the robustness of products . Therefore , this paper describes a holistic methodology that supports the designer in developing a robust product layout including an initial , validated tolerance specification based on the functional requirements . The proposed framework focuses on the close linkage of robust design activities with product data along the product development process and demonstrates the resulting benefits of an early consideration of variations and tolerances . In addition to the proper choice of robust product concepts and their corresponding spatial arrangement in the product structure , the approach allows a conceptual tolerance specification and the subsequent CADbased analysis based on the preliminary design . Thus , the proposed approach aims to reduce iterations in the conventional tolerancing . To demonstrate the process , the methodology is applied to an electric window regulator .",various robust design methods,30,34,products,11,12,"Although various robust design methods have been evolved to support the design of products, these methods are not sufficiently integrated into early stages of the product development process ."
"The studies confirmed that emerging design changes can lead to retesting and changes in future testing plans . In particular , a change may nullify some of the already - completed tests , may necessitate more testing , and may raise questions regarding whether completed testing was adequate or was performed in the right way .

The validation manager will require testing to be planned both for that particular component and for affected components . Engineers might not necessarily perform the same testing activities as in a previous stage but incorporate new testing parameters .

"Bearings are the core components of ship propulsion shafting , and effective prediction of their working condition is crucial for reliable operation of the shaft system . Shafting vibration signals can accurately represent the running condition of bearings . Therefore , in this article , we propose a new model that can reliably predict the vibration signal of bearings . The proposed method is a combination of a fuzzy - modified Markov model with gray error based on particle swarm optimization ( PGFM ( 1,1 ) ) . First , particle swarm optimization was used to optimize and analyze the three related parameters in the gray model ( GM ( 1,1 ) ) that affect the data fitting accuracy , to improve the data fitting ability of GM ( 1,1 ) and form a GM ( 1,1 ) based on particle swarm optimization , which is called PGM ( 1,1 ) . Second , considering that the influence of historical relative errors generated by data fitting on subsequent data prediction cannot be expressed quantitatively , the fuzzy mathematical theory was introduced to make fuzzy corrections to the historical errors . Finally , a Markov model is combined to predict the next development state of bearing vibration signals and form the PGFM ( 1,1 ) . In this study , the traditional predictions of GM ( 1,1 ) , PGM ( 1,1 ) , and newly proposed PGFM ( 1,1 ) are carried out on the same set of bearing vibration data , to make up for the defects of the original model layer by layer and form a set of perfect forecast system models .

"Isostructural DA complexes formed by DPTTA and TCNQ ( = 1 , 2 , 4 ) display narrow optical bandgap in the range of 0.31 to 0.41 eV , and continuous down shift of the VBM and CBM . This leads to a thermal activated bipolar character and majority carrier switching from hole dominated semiconductor in 1 TCNQ complex to electron dominated semiconductor in 4 TCNQ complex . This result shows that tuning of the molecular frontier energy level and the intermolecular interactions including the charge transfer degree , intermolecular electronic coupling can be easily realized in the DA complex systems , which leads to the efficient tuning of the band structure of organic semiconductors .

"Taken together , what this study revealed so far provides two meaningful insights for understanding developmental aspects of Korean-speaking L2 learners of English in their beginning stage of language acquisition . First , L2 learners ' pathway to acquisition of the target language may be guided by characteristics of input that is provided . The current research shows that instruction skewed towards English ASCs with their representative verbs boosted participants ' comprehension of the target language system . Also , despite the fact that the participants did not overcome the complexity of three - argument constructions , the manner in which they were instructed allowed them to produce sentence patterns centred on verbs that were representative of the target constructions . These observations may thus indicate the connection between the frequency - sensitive exposure to English ASCs - verb sets and language behaviours by Korean-speaking L2 learners of English . Second , language learners ' employment of human domaingeneral cognitive factors may coordinate the overall progress of language acquisition . As explained earlier , during ( and after ) the exposure to English ASCs with their representative verbs , the participants in this study utilised narrowly fixed combinations of language items repetitively and fused their prior language knowledge into new sentential information salient to what they were given . Therefore , the behaviours manifested by the participants may suggest the gradual growth of the target language system driven by cognitive endeavour , thereby corresponding to the major assumptions of usage - based constructional approaches to language development . presented in the Constructionist Approaches to Language Pedagogy 2 conference ( 2016 , June ) and the 35th Second Language Research Forum ( 2016 , September ) ; my sincere gratitude goes to the session chairperson of the Constructionist Approaches to Language Pedagogy 2 conference , Catherine Diederich , and anonymous reviewers and participants of the two conferences for many helpful comments .

"A preliminary conclusion of this comparative analysis is that internally consistent decision processes can still result in very large losses when uncertainty is high . These losses are due to lack of external correspondence of the decision maker 's judgment . By contrast , PuCC may be subject to some potential for internal inconsistencies , but it enables better external correspondence in this model since it involves many experts in the decision and focuses their attention on things that are important to the decision outcome . An alternative interpretation of the simulation results is that the DBD framework was overly penalized in this model by restriction to a single decision maker . The DBD framework does not preclude the individual decision maker from gathering and incorporating the views of several experts , so perhaps the single expert should be given a lower value than any one of the multiple experts that are individually contributing to the PuCC process .",PuCC,44,45,several experts,129,131,no relation found

"Here we see some overlap between Trudgill 's criteria and those proposed by other authors . Within the objective criteria , articulatory distance could be the same as Trudgill 's phonetically radically different criterion if the term ' phonetic ' is meant to include articulatory and not just acoustic measures . It is expected that the greater the distance , the more salient the difference between the variants will be . Similarly , phonemicity ( equivalent to Trudgill 's involved in phonological contrast ) will cause a variant to be salient . The more geographically widespread a given dialectal variant is geographically , the more salient it is predicted to be ( areal distribution ) . The continuous versus dichotomous criterion suggests that linguistic variables that have only two variants with no intermediate forms are more salient than those that have a gradient realization . Variables involved in phonological rules that are lexicalized ( i.e. only apply in particular lexical items ) are predicted to be more salient than those that apply uniformly throughout the lexicon ( lexicalization ) . Within the subjective criteria , the greater the perceptual distance between a dialect 1 ( D1 ) and a dialect 2 ( D2 ) variant , the greater the salience . A variant is predicted to be salient if it is used in ( usage in ) or in writings by ( representation in lay dialect writing ) . Overlapping with Trudgill 's stigmatization criterion , the stereotyping / mimicking criterion suggests that those variants that are included when imitating or joking about a dialect will be salient .

"The StereoDIC data acquisition system has been successfully implemented in uniaxial compression testing of rock cores as an alternative to conventional data acquisition systems . The use of non-contacting Ster-eoDIC systems in such applications captures the full field shape , deformation and strain fields on the surface of the specimen compared to conventional strain gages and LVDTs that record average values at discrete locations . Therefore , although the precision of the StereoDIC deformation measurements can be as high as the precision of conventional instrumentation , the accuracy of the StereoDIC technology is superior from the perspective of the correctness of the results . The only needed specimen preparation is the application of the speckle on the surface of the specimen . Mechanical properties , such as the modulus of elasticity , are determined in a straightforward manner . The actual size and shape of the specimen is measured by the StereoDIC and the impact of deviations from specimen shape tolerances can be assessed through inspection of the strain field as demonstrated in Specimen Any internal defects , faults and or damage is detected before any evidence appears on the surface of the specimen , as demonstrated in Specimen . The use of a StereoDIC system in uniaxial compression testing allows the engineer to : evaluate the quality of the specimen and the acquired data . avoid areas of local disturbances and failures that produce inconsistent measurements . define multiple "" gages "" of different size and at different locations after the actual loading test is conducted in view of the grain size and internal defects of the material in conjunction with a consideration of the Representative Volume Element . extract a large amount of data compared to conventional methods suitable for statistical analysis in estimating the desired properties .

"Another challenge faced when developing models of the DDP is that every project and design situation is in some respect unique , or at least unique to its participants . Different models deal with this challenge in different ways . Abstract , procedural , and MS / OR models describe the DDP in a generic way expected to be valid in many different contexts . However , as noted earlier , this may present difficulties for practical application . Many analytical models are based on the principle that although each DDP is different , there is an underlying process architecture within each company that remains essentially constant from one product to the next , and that may be modelled . Thus , a process model based on past experience may help to derive insights for future DDPs in similar contexts . However , it seems not entirely clear how process similarity should be understood or assessed , nor what its implications for modelling and analysis might be . In practice , processes change over time , for instance as new technologies become available and become integrated into the designs and as new software tools are rolled out .

There , we also provide illustrative examples that demonstrate how the model can be used to characterise the transient behaviour of the system . Moreover , to check the validity of the formulation , we compare the analytical results with the numerical outcomes obtained from an independent finite element model . In Section 3 , we consider periodic elastic systems connected to arrays of gyroscopic spinners . Specifically , we focus on a triangular elastic medium connected to two types of spinners and show how to realise highly localised waveforms in this medium in the transient regime . The second problem considered involves a gyro-elastic hexagonal lattice containing an interface defined by a heterogeneous system of spinners and we provide transient simulations demonstrating how to produce unidirectional interfacial waves . In Section 4 , two important applications for a hexagonal gyro-elastic lattice are presented . First , we discuss the problem of topological protection in a lattice with a hexagonal domain that contains a cavity and is excited on the exterior boundary . There , unidirectional edge waves travel along the external boundary of the lattice , leaving the interior almost undisturbed . Second , we design a discrete gyro-elastic invisibility cloak , which is capable of hiding a defect in a periodic structured medium . In Section 5 we provide some concluding remarks .

While it is necessary to make decisions to carry out design processes , management decisions made without consultation and consideration of positions are demotivating ; they are often unavoidable but the necessity needs to be justified . In very complex processes , there is inevitably an element of proclamation , because not all participants can be consulted and rationales cannot be given in a succinct enough way that people can engage with them .

"This part of the section demonstrates working of self contained actuators unit in restoring system performance in event of actuator faults taking place in wide area control of power system . The reconfigurable control on actuator fault restructures feedback loop such that WAC driven by multiple actuators makes for an self contained actuators unit capable of restoring system performance without depending on any redundant actuator outside the unit . The reconfiguration component ( RC ) embedded in the feedback loop gets activated on actuator fault and redistributes the wide area control input from WRDC among the remaining active actuators of the unit . The design implementation of reconfigurable control shows onlineactivation of reconfiguration component ( RC ) on actuator fault . This results in two reconfigured signals ( & ) at input and output of WRDC , hiding actuator fault from it . In design implementation along with reconfigured signals shown are actual output and input signals of power system ( & ) respectively . The redistribution of control signal by RC on actuator fault to remaining active actuators is seen in actual input signal ( ) . The distribution of control input among the actuators unit is dynamic and changes based upon actuator faults . The parameters of RC corresponding to a actuator fault are determined online and control reconfiguration happens in real time .

"Background : Assessment policies and practices are key to the success of curriculum innovations . Therefore , large - scale ELT innovations always include changes in assessment too . Thinking that Iranian students were not enabled to communicate in English after six years of English education in public schools , educational policy makers have recently embarked on a new curriculum that is thought to be a departure from traditional reading and grammar approach towards a communicative one . This study investigated the impact of a recent language assessment reform ( LAR ) on Iranian English teachers ' assessment practices . Methods : To this end , four teachers participated in a focused group interview ( FGI ) session . Teacher - made tests were also collected and scrutinized . Both FGI and test data were content analyzed and the recurring themes were derived . Results : It was revealed that managerial , institutional , and individual barriers stand in the way of the reform . First , the managerial , technocratic approach to reform implementation has caused teachers not to take ownership of the reform . Secondly , at the institutional level , two obstacles were identified in the way of reform : inadequate resources within schools and the accountability demands that foster grade inflation . Finally , regarding professional competencies , teachers appeared to be largely unprepared to conduct language assessments consistent with the LAR demands . In particular , they seemed to have difficulties with the contents of their assessments , with the reasons for doing assessments , and with adjusting their assessments in keeping with LAR communicative aspirations .

"Applying the experimental approach may also be somewhat difficult , but in a different way from the problems with the criterialist approach discussed above . The main difficulty with the experimental approach comes from the careful preparation of the experimental materials and planning of the procedure . To be able to draw conclusions about the salience of dialectal differences , stimuli must be generated that accurately capture the nature of the different dialect variants without introducing other cues that listeners could potentially use in their judgments . Avoiding these undesired cues can be difficult because while a certain set of dialectal differences are actively included in the investigation , it is not always known what other potential variants could be indexing the same social characteristic . One way to help avoid the effects of unknown dialect variants is to include control trials that are similar in structure to the test trials but do not contain any of the dialectal differences of interest , as was done in MacLeod ( 2012 ) . The response accuracy on the control trials can then be compared to chance levels . If the control trials were accurately responded to more often than chance would predict , this would indicate that the listeners were making use of an unknown but at least somewhat reliable aspect of the acoustic signal to make their judgments . If , on the other hand , the accuracy rates of the control trials did not exceed chance , then researchers could be fairly sure that any deviation from chance on the test trials was due to the effect of dialectal differences of interest , giving an accurate representation of the salience of those differences .",dialectal differences,57,59,interest,161,162,no relation found

Furthermore , rich topological phase transitions can be achieved in these materials by strain . Under biaxial strain , a series of transitions can be realized .

As advisors , they are more concerned about how the work can be improved if they do not meet the prescribed criteria . The moral obligation of advisors is to help and support the candidates in improving the work by giving suggestions and advice so that the work meets the criteria .

"In the case studies , issues identified through physical testing are often addressed by rework in the next stage Thus , it is expected that the insights will not all be applicable in other engineering design contexts . For example , in very large - scale projects such as aircraft design or system - ofsystem development , system - level testing from the beginning of the process ( e.g. , using the equivalent of the MULE trucks / engines discussed earlier ) is typically not possible . The insights presented here would need to be extended to cover this and other differences , and further empirical work is needed to do so . Additional future research directions may be suggested . First , there is a need to develop prescriptive process models to convey best practices relating to testing and its integration with the design process .

Second , comparison of the empirical insights with the mathematical and simulation models of testing reviewed in 3.1 also reveals some gaps that could be explored using such models , and accordingly some opportunities for research . One such gap is that the reviewed models all assume that there is sufficient upfront understanding of testing tasks that can be used .

"Beyond predator - prey ecology , our findings also suggest that Parrondo 's paradox could have much broader relevance to biology than currently appreciated . In particular , our analysis of predator dormancy could be a useful framework for the analysis of closely related biological dynamics , such as dormancy in prey , host - parasite coevolution , and any other system which exhibits self- destructive dynamics akin to overpredation . For example , switches between lytic infection and lysogeny in bacteriophages could be considered a kind of "" parasite dormancy , "" where the bacteriophage alternates between dormancy through lysogeny and activity through host-destroying lytic infection . Parrondo 's paradox might then explain how this alternation emerges as a stable strategy .

"Filtering methods are based on the definition of predicted and unpredicted , desired and undesired as well as negligible physical phenomena . Starting from these definitions , physical phenomena were divided into three main classes : PP - , PP = and PP ?. instances represent discarded phenomena , PP = instances are predicted phenomena that appear both in the new and old design , PP ? are phenomena belonging only to a new design and they encompass unpredicted phenomena . The filtering methods are able to keep track of changes during the process of designing and / or redesigning , to understand the consequences of product evolution and product module integration . Then , in the PP ? class , the designer can detect design failures that warn of possible unwanted behaviors of the product . At this point , the design can still be reconsidered without constructing prototypes . Two filtering methods were described , the contrast and the interaction finding methods . The designer can use them separately or together , in design tasks that assume the evolution of a product from configuration A to configuration or the analysis of interactions among different design modules . The contrast method categorizes physical phenomena based on design modifications that constitute differences between the old and the new design . By assuming a product made by clearly defined and understood modules , the interaction finding method is capable to detect interactions of design modules . A case study ( 3.5 ) has shown the profitable use of the Design Interference Detector ( DID ) for different design tasks : design from the scratch , redesign from an old to a new model , and interaction finding . In Case 1 , filtering methods were not used that correspond to a situation where the designer does not have any expert knowledge to filter out phenomena ( design from scratch ) . In Cases 2 and 3 , the filters were relevant to reduce the list of attention points for the designer . The efficiency of the filters depends on the available knowledge about the system ; the more knowledge , the less unpredicted phenomena . Consequently , the filtering methods reduce the large number of possible solutions generated by qualitative reasoning to a smaller number , which is easier to verify for a single designer .",the filters,326,328,design modules,196,198,no relation found

"The qualitative scores for the power interconnects are calculated by counting the number of power interconnects in each layer of the 2D/3D chip stack . This is then normalized with respect to the total number of interconnects that is physically possible to be realized in a 3D chip stack . This normalization ensures a fair comparison between designs of different physical sizes . The number of power interconnects for MPUs are counted double that for memory chips . This is to resolve a qualitative difference between the two . It is assumed that the signal interconnects needed between the MPU and the memory chip , and the signal interconnects needed between the 3D stack and devices outside of the package are determined by the bandwidth requirements , and are fixed . These interconnects are counted as a single unit each . The total possible number of interconnects in a 2D/3D chip stack is calculated by assuming that each layer is populated by all possible interconnects , i.e. : 1 ) power interconnects for MPU ( 2 units ) , 2 ) power interconnects for memory ( 1 unit ) , 3 ) signal TSVs ( 1 unit ) , which represent a maximum total of 4 units per layer that carries interconnects . Since in all our configurations , the TC is always facing down , it never contains any TSVs / interconnects in that layer and is not counted .

"Hardware reverse engineering is a powerful and universal tool for both security engineers and adversaries . From a defensive perspective , it allows for detection of intellectual property infringements and hardware Trojans , while it simultaneously can be used for product piracy and malicious circuit manipulations . From a designer 's perspective , it is crucial to have an estimate of the costs associated with reverse engineering , yet little is known about this , especially when dealing with obfuscated hardware . The contribution at hand provides new insights into this problem , based on algorithms with sound mathematical underpinnings . Our contributions are threefold : First , we present the graph similarity problem for automating hardware reverse engineering . To this end , we improve several state - of - the - art graph similarity heuristics with optimizations tailored to the hardware context . Second , we propose a novel algorithm based on multiresolutional spectral analysis of adjacency matrices . Third , in three extensively evaluated case studies , namely ( 1 ) gate - level netlist reverse engineering , ( 2 ) hardware Trojan detection , and ( 3 ) assessment of hardware obfuscation , we demonstrate the practical nature of graph similarity algorithms .",contribution,83,84,hardware reverse engineering,116,119,Our contribution includes graph similarity for automating hardware reverse engineering.
"From the numerical point of view , when the reaction front velocity drops , longer time steps t are required for moving the reaction front by the constant spatial step , as is done in the numerical procedure . In this case , the numerical method , which is used in this paper , looses accuracy due to a coarse discretisation of the equations in time . The case of small reaction front velocities should be studied separately using the finite element technique with a conforming mesh with respect to the reaction front . In this paper , the simulations were terminated when reached small values , as explained in Section 3.6 .",the numerical method,43,46,the reaction front,8,11,The numerical method looses accuracy when the reaction front velocity drops.
"The previous experiments have considered both platforms independently and shown that they exhibit significantly different power and performance profiles . This is expected since the Zynq device is considered a low - cost embedded device while the much larger Zynq Ultrascale is oriented towards high - performance applications . Overall , the performance per Watt of the high - end Ultrascale device is significantly better than the Zynq device . If we just compare this raw performance per watt in a deployment that keeps both devices always active with no idle times it is clear that the Ultrascale device will be the preferred solution .

"When HIFs occur , the fault characteristic is not obvious . Since the precision of the zero-sequence CT is limited and the fault characteristic signal is greatly affected by interference signals , it is difficult to select the fault line correctly . In cooperation with the multi-mode grounding control , the neutral - point can be switched into low-resistance mode to amplify the fault characteristic . In this situation , the voltages of the sound phases are almost unchanged . Thus , the fault line can be selected by comparing the phase differences of the zerosequence current mutation and fault - phase voltage mutation before and after the fault between the lines . The coordination strategy of the multi-mode grounding control and the fault line selection scheme is shown in .",the zero-sequence CT,15,18,the fault characteristic,4,7,no relation found

"Selection of suitable computer - supported collaborative design ( CSCD ) technologies is crucial to facilitate successful projects . This paper presents the first systematic method for engineering design teams to evaluate and select the most suitable CSCD technologies comparing technology functionality and project requirements established in peer-reviewed literature . The paper first presents 220 factors that influence successful CSCD . These factors were then systematically mapped and categorised to create CSCD requirement statements . The novel evaluation and selection method incorporates these requirement statements within a matrix and develops a discourse analysis text processing algorithm with data from collaborative projects to automate the population of how technologies impact the success of CSCD in engineering design teams . This method was validated using data collected across 3 years of a student global design project . The impact of this method is the potential to change the way engineering design teams consider the technology they use and how the selection of appropriate tools impacts the success of their CSCD projects .

The project is also hoped to promote cooperation among educational institutions and facilitate communication between educational institutions and government organizations . In addition , the project is intended to contribute to the debate on whether a common European framework ( i.e. , the CEFR ) would suffice for language education worldwide , whether local versions of the CEFR ( e.g. , the CEFR - ) should be developed , or whether new frameworks ( e.g. , the CSE ) should be developed and implemented in a country where English is taught , learnt and used as a foreign language .",educational institutions,65,67,China,41,42,Educational institutions are in China.
"The Algorithm 2 shows the procedure performed in 5 clock cycles for the ECC bits . Our algorithm uses two registers of 8 bits named Reg and as support . Reg is the counter that determines which bit of the register u computes the with the input bit ( a memory I / O pin ) . The register stores the ECC bits calculated by Hamming . In the first cc , the ECC module increases the Reg register ; then it computes the of each incoming bit , and the corresponding position bit ( lines 3 through 7 ) . In the second cc , the ECC module increases Reg register , and if its value is a power of 2 , Reg again is increased . The ECC module repeats this process for each 8 - bit data sent to memory until Reg changes to 0 ( Reg is an 8 - bit register , so the next value of 255 is 0 ) , indicating that 247 bits have been computed . Finally , in the third , fourth and fifth cc the ECC module computes the of 8 - bits of the register ( line 12 ) and writes the data to the RAM used for ECC ( line 13 ) . For our data storage system will be compatible with others industrial applications , it is necessary that the FPGA will be 10 times faster than the frequency of the WE pin .

"We develop a new effective mathematical formulation and resulting universal computational algorithm capable of tackling various HF models in the framework of a unified approach . The scheme is not limited to any particular elasticity operator or crack propagation regime . Its basic assumptions are : ( i ) proper choice of independent and dependent variables ( with the direct utilization of a new one - the reduced particle velocity ) , ( ii ) tracing the fracture front by use of the Stefan condition ( speed equation ) , which can be integrated in closed form and provides an explicit relation between the crack propagation speed and the coefficients in the asymptotic expansion of the crack opening , ( iii ) proper regularization techniques , ( iv ) improved temporal approximation , ( ) modular algorithm architecture . The application of the new dependent variable , the reduced particle velocity , instead of the usual fluid flow rate , facilitates the computation of the crack propagation speed from the local relation based on the speed equation . This way , we avoid numerical evaluation of the undetermined limit of the product of fracture aperture and pressure gradient at the crack tip ( or alternatively the limit resulting from ratio of the fluid flow rate and the crack opening ) , which always poses a considerable computational challenge . As a result , the position of the crack front is accurately determined from an explicit formula derived from the speed equation . This approach leads to a robust numerical scheme . Its performance is demonstrated using classical examples of 1 models for hydraulic fracturing : PKN and KGD models under various fracture propagation regimes . Solution accuracy is verified against dedicated analytical benchmarks and other solutions available in the literature . The scheme can be directly extended to more general 2 and 3D cases .",the crack front,236,239,dedicated analytical benchmarks,290,293,The crack front is verified with dedicated analytical benchmarks.

"The difference between high and low stakes assessment has a crucial impact on all aspects of benchmark development , including objectives , targets and the number of scales . The main aim of administering the LPATE as a high - stakes benchmark in Hong Kong is to discriminate between the classroom language use of EFL teachers and to maintain their English teaching quality at or above an established minimum level . To accomplish this , the benchmarks are focused on certain limited scales , a single set of four constructs in this case , for practicality of administration . Our benchmark assessment , on the other hand , is intended to be used for professional development on a voluntary basis at a smaller scale , to encourage English teachers to be more aware of their classroom English use , for example in post-lesson observation conferences in schools and graduate programs or inservice teacher seminars at or in - service training sessions . In such situations only a single set of four construct scales would be inadequate to describe a given EFL teacher 's multifaceted teacher language proficiency . Second , while the five - level rating method with Level 3 being ' acceptable ' is used in LPATE 's CLA , our benchmark assessment employs a four-level rating method with Level 2 as the ' acceptable ' benchmark . This choice was made because in conducting teacher - friendly benchmark assessment within a certain limited time frame with teacher development in mind , it is believed that the number of rating levels should be as manageable as possible , while , at the same time , the ' acceptable ' benchmark level should not be set too high . The description of Level 1 in our benchmarks is also labeled as ' not yet acceptable ' , rather than being worded more negatively , in the hope that those who are assessed will be encouraged to persevere in their efforts to attain a higher level of competence . Third , since the main objective of the LPATE is to assess the English proficiency of EFL teachers , it pays less attention to the function of TLA , while our benchmark assessment is intended to facilitate EFL teachers ' TLA and encourage them to pay more attention to their English use in the classroom , thereby providing better learning environments for their students .

The CEFR 's non-prescriptive scheme and illustrative descriptors make it flexible and internationally applicable , but as is mentioned in the introduction part , in order to increase the efficiency of English language teaching and assessment practice in China , a unified English language ability scale would serve as a standard which can be prescriptively applied off the shelf . In addition , Chinese learners may have different language use situations and cognitive styles from the European learners , so the construct should be defined in a different way . Furthermore , China has millions of English learners across the country with diverse learning conditions and proficiency levels , which requires the levels of the scales to be as fine - grained as possible .",some specific considerations,38,41,the Chinese school system,84,88,There are some specific considerations in the Chinese school system.

"At least three physical markers should be identifiable and set up in a non-symmetrical configuration . The positions that the markers indicate should be known in tube reference , that is , in for the leg tube and in S for the stub tube . There is a slight difference between the cases for leg and stub tubes . The leg tube already has a working reference defined by punch marks on the tube around the joint curve area . These punch marks are observable via the on- site metrology system , and are obvious candidate locations for placing physical markers . The stub tube does not have any physical reference , which is essentially introduced by the cutting process ; thought in practice the weld seam of the welded tube is always used in the toe of the saddle - cut . Hence with respect to the stub reference , we only need to relate the captured mesh to the machine reference . In essence this latter may be achieved by either controlling the tool to make an observably large cut into the tube end , at a position with known machine reference , which is trivial , since the tool is controlled in machine reference . It is worth noting that once the saddle - cut in the stub has been made , the fit process on the leg tube will arrange for the correct posing of the stub . That is , it is not necessary to further establish an identifiable reference on the cut stub , though it may later be desired if it optimizes the fit process .",essence,165,166,the saddle - cut,138,142,"In essence, the weld seam of the welded tube is always used in the toe of the saddle - cut."

"A novel hierarchical methodology for reconfigurable devices is presented . A bespoke multi-reconfigurable FPGA architecture , the programmable analogue and digital array ( PAnDA ) , is introduced allowing fine - grained reconfiguration beyond any other FPGA architecture currently in existence .

Two fault recovery techniques , stochastic and deterministic strategies , are proposed and results of each , as well as a comparison of the two , are presented . Both approaches are based on creating algorithms performing fine - grained hierarchical partial reconfiguration on faulty circuits in order to repair them . While the stochastic approach provides insights into feasibility of the method , the deterministic approach aims to generate optimal repair strategies for generic faults induced into a specific circuit .

"Modern Convolutional Neural Networks ( CNNs ) require a massive amount of convolution operations . To address the overwhelming computation problem , Winograd and FFT fast algorithms have been used as effective approaches to reduce the number of multiplications . Inputs and filters are transformed into special domains then perform element - wise multiplication , which can be transformed into batched GEMM operation . Different stages of computation contain multiple tasks with different computation and memory behaviors , and they share intermediate data , which provides the opportunity to fuse these tasks into a monolithic kernel . But traditional kernel fusion suffers from the problem of insufficient shared memory , which limits the performance . In this article , we propose a new kernel fusion technique for fast convolution algorithms based on Mega Kernel . GPU thread blocks are assigned with different computation tasks and we design a mapping algorithm to assign tasks to thread blocks . We build a scheduler which fetches and executes the tasks following the dependency relationship . Evaluation of modern CNNs shows that our techniques achieve an average of 1.25 and 1.7X speedup compared to cuDNN 's two implementations on Winograd convolution algorithm .",we,119,120,Winograd convolution algorithm,195,198,no relation found

"aircraft manufacturers , Airbus and Boeing , rely on their single aisle , shorter range products as consistent revenue streams . The Airbus A320 first flew in 1987 and the Boeing 737 first flew in 1967 ( Norris 2014 ) . To reduce risk , these companies have adopted an iterative development approach to their products as opposed to regular new product introduction . This approach has been vindicated by the record sales achieved by the latest iteration of the Airbus A320 , known as NEO ( 2014 ) . With an extensive order book secured , the company has now shifted its focus onto cost reduction to maximise profits and to accommodate rises in other costs , such as inflation .

"The figure shows that more vCPUs are allocated to the VM , the execution time decreases significantly for the workload when it runs in the vanilla VM . However , the memory - based swap does not support such scalability . As the local memory size decreases from L32 to L8 , the swap system suffers from significant increases of execution times . In addition , even if the number of vCPUs increases , the execution times are increased in L16 and L8 . The results show that the current swap system cannot properly handle the frequent memory reclaim and fetch operations required for the disaggregated memory . However , by the scalable design of dcm , such as the per-vCPU data structures , scalable memory state management , and lockless writeback descriptor , dcm can provide relatively minor increases of execution times compared to the ideal vanilla VM .

This further shows that , although a projected act can also have an absolute subject , the absolute subject of a projected fact is more independent . Subject clauses are fact clauses .

The content of students ' online discussion on Facebook group was the source of the data in this study . The discussion content was transcribed , coded , and analyzed , and the frequencies of categories were calculated to determine students ' use of SP expressions . The findings of the study revealed that students focus on delivering more interactive response ( IR ) posts across all learning topics . Interestingly , although SNS are social in nature , this study revealed that students ' use of SP expressions on SNS was intended to improve course discussion interactivity rather than for pure socializing purpose . However , more theoretical topics triggered higher number of SP posts compared with technical focused topics . More importantly , the way students used SP expressions during courserelated interaction through Facebook may contribute to improved performance in test .",The findings,125,127,this study,25,27,The findings of this study revealed that student focus more on interactive responses.

"To overcome the limitations of the set composition - based , graph theoretical representation ( discussed in Sect .3.2 ) and to make use of already existing design knowledge with the designers , an EF - tree was created for the pump model , extending on the model created by the set composition . In this case , the function ' intercomponent attachment ' was divided into two ( ' enable suction attachment ' and enable ' discharge attachment ' ) , following axiomatic design principles . While creating the initial graph , this was identified as only one function . The ' intercomponent attachment ' is a function that needs to be satisfied at multiple locations in the casing . That is , the function is satisfied by different regions of the casing . Axiomatically , one function is satisfied by one and only one design parameter ; in our case a design solution , which is a section of the casing . Therefore , the function was split according to the location at which it is demanded , to be satisfied by a section at that region . These sections are the ' suction flange ' and the ' discharge flange ' . This enables us to use the EF - tree , the definition of which is based on axiomatic principles .

"This paper uses 3D printing methods to overcome mass and heat transport limitations in small - scale processes for the conversion of syngas to ethanol . Advances in the past two decades in technologies had resulted in a new generation of highly active catalysts . These catalysts are formed into porous pellets or monoliths and placed into the reactors which often operate at elevated temperatures and pressures . The key problem with this arrangement is that transport rates are of different orders of magnitudes within the particles which is dominated by ( slow ) diffusion , and between the particles , which is set by ( fast ) pressure driven viscous flow . Balancing these timescales requires either ( i ) making the pellets very small , so that the diffusion path lengths and hence travel times are reducedbut this so severely impacts the pressure drop over the system that it is impractical ; or ( ii ) increasing the residence time in the reactor and / or reducing the reaction rate by limiting the catalyst activity ( which is the currently used solution , where typically catalyst carriers dilute the active materials by > 90 ) , but this results in very large reactor sizes . Further , for highly energetic reactions requiring intensive heating or cooling , packed beds and monoliths becomes limited by the poor heat transfer properties of the arrangement . Poor temperature control results in reduced conversion efficiency , and a wider range of products and which in turn require additional downstream separation and purification operations .

"Abstract - Physical unclonable functions ( PUFs ) are security primitives that enable the extraction of digital identifiers from electronic devices , based on the inherent silicon process variations between devices which occur during the manufacturing process . Due to the intrinsic and lightweight nature of a PUF , they have been proposed to provide security at a low cost for many applications , in particular for the internet of things ( IoT ) . Many metrics have been proposed to evaluate the security and performance of PUF architectures , two of which are uniqueness and . The uniqueness of a PUF response evaluates its ability to differentiate between different physical devices , while the min-entropy estimation is a measure of how much uncertainty the PUF response contains . The is a lower - bound of real entropy . When the uniqueness of a PUF design is close to the optimal , it is unclear if this also implies that the design has a significantly high entropy ; hence it would be useful to ascertain the minimum uniqueness required to achieve a given entropy . To date , a thorough investigation of the relationship between uniqueness and entropy for PUF designs has not been conducted . In this paper , this relationship between the uniqueness and entropy is explored , and for the first time , to the authors ' knowledge , the relationship between them is modeled . To verify this model , both simulated and hardware - based experimental results are performed , with a test - bed containing 184 Xilinx Artix -7 FPGA based Basys3 boards providing a large data set for granular results . The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model accurately estimates the relationship between uniqueness and , with both the theoretical analysis and software simulations closely matching the experimental results .",the authors ' knowledge,227,231,many applications,61,63,no relation found

"First , a modelling is given of functions of two specific categories . This modelling is secondly extended to the composition relation between subfunctions and functions . Yet , using this modelling , it is thirdly proved that this composition relation cannot be analysed as a formal parthood relation for functions . According to mereology , the formal theory of parthood , a relation should at least meet three postulates for being a parthood relation , and it is shown that the composition relation for functions fails to do so . Possibly , it may be beneficial in design methods to informally understand subfunctions as parts of the functions they compose . This understanding may , for instance , be helpful because it suggests to designers to consider the design solutions to subfunctions as parts of the solutions to the overall functions . Providing propulsion is typically a subfunction of the overall function of many vehicles , and the engines that solve this subfunction are typically physical parts of the vehicles .

Similar behavior can be seen for tangential component as the constant number increases . Tangential velocity is a function of rotational speed as expected , the stretching parameter A increases as the tangential velocity is retarded as evident from Figure4 ( ) . Because when the disk stretches the fluid particle above the disk surface , it gets some space and becomes relaxed for a while ; as a result , their tangential velocity and temperature reduce , which causes to decrease the fluid velocity and the average temperature of fluid .

"The difference between high and low stakes assessment has a crucial impact on all aspects of benchmark development , including objectives , targets and the number of scales . The main aim of administering the LPATE as a high - stakes benchmark in Hong Kong is to discriminate between the classroom language use of EFL teachers and to maintain their English teaching quality at or above an established minimum level . To accomplish this , the benchmarks are focused on certain limited scales , a single set of four constructs in this case , for practicality of administration . Our benchmark assessment , on the other hand , is intended to be used for professional development on a voluntary basis at a smaller scale , to encourage English teachers to be more aware of their classroom English use , for example in post-lesson observation conferences in schools and graduate programs or inservice teacher seminars at or in - service training sessions . In such situations only a single set of four construct scales would be inadequate to describe a given EFL teacher 's multifaceted teacher language proficiency . Second , while the five - level rating method with Level 3 being ' acceptable ' is used in LPATE 's CLA , our benchmark assessment employs a four-level rating method with Level 2 as the ' acceptable ' benchmark . This choice was made because in conducting teacher - friendly benchmark assessment within a certain limited time frame with teacher development in mind , it is believed that the number of rating levels should be as manageable as possible , while , at the same time , the ' acceptable ' benchmark level should not be set too high . The description of Level 1 in our benchmarks is also labeled as ' not yet acceptable ' , rather than being worded more negatively , in the hope that those who are assessed will be encouraged to persevere in their efforts to attain a higher level of competence . Third , since the main objective of the LPATE is to assess the English proficiency of EFL teachers , it pays less attention to the function of TLA , while our benchmark assessment is intended to facilitate EFL teachers ' TLA and encourage them to pay more attention to their English use in the classroom , thereby providing better learning environments for their students . Keeping these contrasts between the current benchmark assessment and LPATE 's CLA in mind , we turn to describing the development of each of the four scales in our benchmark assessment .",Level,198,199,EFL teachers,54,56,no relation found

"Background : Assessment policies and practices are key to the success of curriculum innovations . Therefore , large - scale ELT innovations always include changes in assessment too . Thinking that Iranian students were not enabled to communicate in English after six years of English education in public schools , educational policy makers have recently embarked on a new curriculum that is thought to be a departure from traditional reading and grammar approach towards a communicative one . This study investigated the impact of a recent language assessment reform ( LAR ) on Iranian English teachers ' assessment practices . Methods : To this end , four teachers participated in a focused group interview ( FGI ) session . Teacher - made tests were also collected and scrutinized . Both FGI and test data were content analyzed and the recurring themes were derived . Results : It was revealed that managerial , institutional , and individual barriers stand in the way of the reform . First , the managerial , technocratic approach to reform implementation has caused teachers not to take ownership of the reform . Secondly , at the institutional level , two obstacles were identified in the way of reform : inadequate resources within schools and the accountability demands that foster grade inflation . Finally , regarding professional competencies , teachers appeared to be largely unprepared to conduct language assessments consistent with the LAR demands . In particular , they seemed to have difficulties with the contents of their assessments , with the reasons for doing assessments , and with adjusting their assessments in keeping with LAR communicative aspirations .

"In this research , students in NOR , CEN and SOU showed variations in their perceptions of the policy across the first two factors , factor 1 ' Benefits ' and factor 2 ' Anxiety ' , respectively . Regarding benefits , a major difference was identified between SOU and CEN students . Those living in SOU were more supportive for the policy than CEN students because it generated their learning motivation , improved English proficiency , directed learning and enhanced competitiveness in both future workplace and further education . This reflects the fact that students from developing and urban contexts acknowledge the ELPTs , the policy and English language skills as essential assets for their future . For the factor 2 ' Anxiety ' , there were also varying responses from NOR , CEN and SOU students , placing NOR in the first , CEN in the second and SOU in the last for the levels of anxiety . This variation may be interpreted as being due to the heavy influence of Confucianism and socio-economic development , NOR and CEN students were under more pressure and anxiety compared to SOU counterparts . For students studying in CEN , their English proficiency is lower because of difficulties in socio-economic development and less opportunities for English language learning .",students,4,5,the policy,17,19,"Students in NOR , CEN and SOU showed variations in their perceptions of the policy."

This paper presents design of an self contained actuators unit in wide area damping control of power system in stabilizing system response for both nominal system condition and during actuator faults . First it is presented that use of multiple actuators in wide area control aid in improving damping in power system . A wide area damping controller feeding multiple actuators to satisfy multiple objectives in wide area damping control of power system is designed . Minimization of infinity norm of closed loop transfer function of power system with wide area controller in feedback path & closed loop poles placement techniques are used in controller synthesis . Second a reconfigurable control on the lines of fault hiding principle is added to the controller design to maintain system damping to pre-fault level in case of actuator faults . A reconfiguration component ( RC ) is activated on occurrence of actuator fault thereby reconfiguring system dynamics and redistributing wide area control signal among remaining active actuators . RC together with remaining active actuators and under same wide area damping controller maintains system damping to pre-fault level thereby preserving system dynamic response . In the reconfigurable control design presented here no new actuators outside the unit of actuators designed for wide area damping control is required . This makes for an self contained actuators unit in wide area damping control of power system both for nominal system condition and for system affected by actuator faults . A two area power system model is considered here for demonstrating effectiveness of designed robust damping controller with multiple outputs feeding multiple actuators in wide area control and illustrating the idea of self contained actuators unit for maintaining system damping in case of actuator faults .,effectiveness,254,255,actuator faults,29,31,no relation found

"The results for Z2 are again noticeably better than for the other three circuits , which all perform similarly . The balance of redundancy and utilisation in this circuit resonate with this methodology well for two reasons : first , by utilising slightly more than half of the branches of a slice , faults are more likely to occur in utilised branches , leaving redundant ones less likely to be faulty and increasing the probability that spares will be fault - free when required . Second , having slightly less than half of the CAB branches not utilised leaves a lot of redundancy for branches to move into .

"The eighth assumption , which is derived from the human rights literature on North Korea , avers that North Korea has been actively using human rights discourse in its public discourse .

Its discursive approach therefore is philosophically at odds with the traditional rights - based discursive approach of the United States However , both the United States and North Korea converge on the particularist interpretation to the implementation of rights . The particularist interpretation , as discussed in more detail in Section 3 , asserts that national governments must factor in both the domestic context and social , economic , and political development in their application of a rights - based policy . Greater emphasis on socioeconomic rights rather than sociopolitical rights in North Korea 's rights problem is likely to reduce the government 's hostility to engagement .

"This study investigated the impact of rater attitude towards Indian English , as an example of WE , on scoring for IELTS descriptive tasks . Our findings suggest raters with a positive attitude towards Indian English , according to the RAI , give higher mean scores than the negative attitude groups do in all rating criteria . A comparison of the neutral and negative attitude groups shows differences in the mean score . The category of sentence structure and vocabulary , with the neutral attitude group giving higher mean scores than the negative attitude group did , suggests that raters ' attitude towards Indian English generally relates to their scoring tendency . However , there is less or no effect on scoring fluency and pronunciation . Future research could explore underlying factors in the way raters score fluency and pronunciation through , for example , a verbal protocol report . The overall findings support claims put forward in psychology and language attitude research . A link between rater attitude towards Indian English and scoring tendency for Indian examinees may exist in a language assessment context . Thus , as raters reoriented their views and broadened their grasp of WE , and as awareness of WE increased in the language testing community in recent decades , the findings here show that testing agencies must add an understanding of potential rater bias towards WE to the current relevant literature . We cannot afford to overlook , or be blind to , the possibility of prejudiced or otherwise unfair scoring of speaking tests . The RAI total score was the strongest predictor of IELTS total and subscores . The total variance of the RAI total score ranged from 17.5 in the pronunciation score to 32.4 for vocabulary . This included quite a surprisingly high proportion of variance ( 31.3 ) in the IELTS descriptive task total scores . Therefore , the RAI appears to be an important tool for monitoring and predicting rater attitude tendency prior to actual rating . Ideally , rater attitude should be neutral to avoid giving scores that are either too lenient , as by raters with positive attitude , or too harsh , as by raters with negative attitude . Rater training models may factor in this potential rater bias variable to intervene to reduce prejudice among raters , and to encourage overall neutrality in attitude . Two approaches suggest themselves : first , introducing raters to state - of - art English pedagogical development driven by WE to increase their understanding of the concept of WE ; secondly , bringing WE speakers into rater training sessions to increase raters ' familiarity with the varieties of English among examinees . As the literature suggests , long - lasting stereotypes about non-native varieties are negative .",The total variance,275,278,WE,16,17,no relation found

"Both the available energy and the movement forecast are updated in real- time on the mobile node and the GPS sampling strategy is continuously adapted as new estimates become available . We propose an information - based GPS sampling strategy that considers expected movement duration , expected energy availability , and expected information gain of the next GPS sample . The ratio of the forecast movement duration and forecast remaining energy budget determines an adaptive threshold for the expected tracking error . The maximum tracking error is estimated through dead reckoning and , once it exceeds the adaptive threshold , a new GPS sample is triggered . This threshold balances the expected information gain from a new GPS sample , i.e. , how well the original trajectory can be approximated by taking into account that position , with its cost for longerterm tracking performance . Our simulation results using empirical data traces from wild flying foxes confirm that information - based tracking delivers significant reduction in tracking error compared to static and adaptive GPS sampling and performs close to an offline optimum algorithm .",remaining energy budget,69,72,new estimates,26,28,The ratio of forecast remaining energy budget can be determined with new estimates.

"According to ACDH hypothesis , verbal ( event ) passives with syntactic movement will be more difficult for young children to understand than adjectival ( state ) passives which are without movement , leading to the prediction that Mandarin-speaking children should better understand state passives than event passives .

Firstly , this paper extended the research scope to Mandarin event and state passives in order to provide more evidence for the universality of passive development sequence .

"This study provides empirical evidence on determinants of the financial constraints of SMEs and the effects of financial obstacles on their growth in the emerging economies of the selected SEE countries . While most previous studies have separately examined the determinants of financial constraints and the impact of financial constraints on firm growth , less attention has been paid to their combined analysis and implications . In response , we attempted to investigate the factors affecting perception of financing constraints and perceived financing constraints as a growth determinant of SMEs . Consistent with related empirical findings , our analysis results indicate that financing obstacles are a significant detriment to SME growth in the Western Balkan region . Moreover , the article identifies firm attributes and countryspecific factors that determine the financial constraint levels of SMEs . Specifically , SMEs operating in the trade sector reported fewer financing obstacles than their counterparts in the service and manufacturing industries . Contrary to most previous findings , but in line with recent empirical evidence in the case of the same region , the findings show that financing obstacles increased as firms got older . Furthermore , when we ran separate regressions that included both firmand country - specific variables , among country - specific factors banking industry concentration and credit to private sector retain the significant association with financial constraints in both probit and ordered probit regressions . Thus , it is worth stating that financial infrastructure including banking industry and credit market is an important factor of access to financing for SMEs . SMEs operating in economies with higher per capita GDP reported less growth rate , whereas better regulatory environment was associated with higher growth rate . Although firm size had statistically insignificant effect on access to finance , larger firms report higher growth , and negative relationship between foreign ownership , age , and growth rate was evidenced .

"This study provides empirical evidence on determinants of the financial constraints of SMEs and the effects of financial obstacles on their growth in the emerging economies of the selected SEE countries . While most previous studies have separately examined the determinants of financial constraints and the impact of financial constraints on firm growth , less attention has been paid to their combined analysis and implications . In response , we attempted to investigate the factors affecting perception of financing constraints and perceived financing constraints as a growth determinant of SMEs . Consistent with related empirical findings , our analysis results indicate that financing obstacles are a significant detriment to SME growth in the Western Balkan region . Moreover , the article identifies firm attributes and countryspecific factors that determine the financial constraint levels of SMEs . Specifically , SMEs operating in the trade sector reported fewer financing obstacles than their counterparts in the service and manufacturing industries . Contrary to most previous findings , but in line with recent empirical evidence in the case of the same region , the findings show that financing obstacles increased as firms got older . Furthermore , when we ran separate regressions that included both firmand country - specific variables , among country - specific factors banking industry concentration and credit to private sector retain the significant association with financial constraints in both probit and ordered probit regressions . Thus , it is worth stating that financial infrastructure including banking industry and credit market is an important factor of access to financing for SMEs . SMEs operating in economies with higher per capita GDP reported less growth rate , whereas better regulatory environment was associated with higher growth rate . Although firm size had statistically insignificant effect on access to finance , larger firms report higher growth , and negative relationship between foreign ownership , age , and growth rate was evidenced . To test whether the financial constraint variable is sensitive to measurement changes , we used both dummy and ordinal values of the variable . Moreover , considering potential endogeneity of the financial constraint variable , the Durbin test of augmented was employed , and consistency of our regressions was confirmed .",larger firms,298,300,the significant association,221,224,no relation found

"The Floating nuclear power plant grid is composed of power generation , in - station power supply and external power delivery . To ensure the safety of the nuclear island , the in - station system adopts a special power supply mode , while the external power supply needs to be adapted to different types of external systems .

Based on the maximum united energy entropy ratio ( MUEER ) , the optimal wavelet basis function and decomposition scale are adaptively chosen , while the fault line is selected by wavelet transform modulus maxima ( WTMM ) . For high - impedance faults ( HIFs ) , to enlarge the fault feature , the system grounding mode can be switched by the multi-mode grounding control . Based on the characteristic of HIFs , the fault line can be selected by comparing phase differences of zero-sequence current mutation and fault phase voltage mutation before and after the fault .

"In this study , we demonstrate that ABA restrains root gravitropism and lateral root formation under salt or osmotic stress via a novel branch of the ABA signaling pathway , which involves a complex of the PYLs ABA receptor and PP2A .

Under stress , ABA binds to PYLs and PP2A activity is inhibited , thereby increasing phosphorylation of PIN proteins and in turn inhibiting directional auxin transport activity to contribute to ABA - and stress - disturbed root architecture .

First , after preheating , the organic fluid evaporates into the high - pressure organic steam in the evaporator , and then flows into the expander after being superheated in the superheater . After the heat exchange in the superheater , saturated steam enters the preheater through pipeline 1 . Second , the high - pressure organic steam forces the expander blade to rotate and then drives the generator to generate the electric power . Finally , the organic steam from the expander outlet condenses into liquid in the condenser , before flowing into the refrigerant tank . The organic fluid is driven from the tank to the preheater by the pump and then the cycle is repeated . Excess organic fluid can be stored in the refrigerant tank for adjusting the flow rate . 2 .

"At present , the neutral - point grounding modes of MV distribution power systems can be divided into direct grounding , ungrounding , arc suppression coil grounding and resistance grounding , etc . The MV floating nuclear power plant system has a large capacity with a large number of cable line branches , and the ship hull is directly used as the ground loop . If the ground fault current is large or the arc overvoltage is high , the safety of personnel and equipment in the plant will be compromised . Therefore , the direct grounding and ungrounding modes cannot be adopted . When the neutral - point is grounded through an arc suppression coil , it is difficult to adapt to the change of system operating status and the system can easily oscillate . Since the resistance grounding mode can reduce the fault current and suppress the arc overvoltage , it is thus adopted .",the arc overvoltage,73,76,resistance grounding,28,30,no relation found

Our approach considers runtime parameters whose values are architecture dependent . These parameters can be used to characterize the hardware on which a virtualised environment is executed on a given cloud . In this paper we propose a novel approach that uses a two machine learning prediction technique . The first stage generates a model for each of the runtime parameters . These models are generated by using machine learning techniques and aim to learn the information about the hardware assigned by a cloud to run a given VM type . This is learned indirectly by a ML method which correlates the workflow input with information of the VM type with the runtime parameters . The second stage uses the runtime parameter models generated in the first stage to predict the final execution time of a task .

"The Algorithm 2 shows the procedure performed in 5 clock cycles for the ECC bits . Our algorithm uses two registers of 8 bits named Reg and as support . Reg is the counter that determines which bit of the register u computes the with the input bit ( a memory I / O pin ) . The register stores the ECC bits calculated by Hamming . In the first cc , the ECC module increases the Reg register ; then it computes the of each incoming bit , and the corresponding position bit ( lines 3 through 7 ) . In the second cc , the ECC module increases Reg register , and if its value is a power of 2 , Reg again is increased . The ECC module repeats this process for each 8 - bit data sent to memory until Reg changes to 0 ( Reg is an 8 - bit register , so the next value of 255 is 0 ) , indicating that 247 bits have been computed . Finally , in the third , fourth and fifth cc the ECC module computes the of 8 - bits of the register ( line 12 ) and writes the data to the RAM used for ECC ( line 13 ) .

"The work reported here has focussed on establishing the basic components from which descriptions of complex design practice can be constructed .

"Using the distill tree , we can handle this case as follows : When the addition of two numbers would overflow , instead of producing AE1 , we make the FPART return the outputs in sorted order ( larger input as s , smaller input as . This way , no information is lost . The distillation and sorting continue . If the distillation eventually produces values that would cancel with these values , the sorting would bring them together , cancellation would occur , and the distillation can converge normally . Our early convergence detection scheme will work once proper cancellation of these large values is allowed to occur . However , if we reach a steady state where all numbers are in stable , sorted order and there are still adjacent entries that would overflow , we know that no cancellation will occur - every pair of adjacent numbers has gone through an FPART , meaning there must be no adjacent , overlapping numbers with opposite signs . In this steady state , we can correctly determine that the result is AE1 . We can detect this by having each FPART provide an output signal to indicate when it has performed a sort to avoid overflow . If we reach the distillation tree termination condition and any of the FPARTs has asserted this signal , we can conclude that a real overflow has occurred . These intermediate overflows cause more iterations on average . This technique allows us to provide correct operation in all cases , without complicating the implementation .

"The answer to native linguistic advantage in academic writing for novice L1 writers is more complicated and less clear . L1 student writers , use explicit conjunctions quantitatively similar to L2 graduate student writers . Though they use LGMs more than L2 student writers , they use LGMs significantly less than experienced L1 and L2 scholars . As academic language is quite distinctive from the language native speakers are familiar with when they grow up acquiring the language , being a native speaker does not grant them too much advantage in this sense . However , the qualitative analysis indicates that their lexical choices of explicit conjunctions , causative verbs and nouns are more diversified than L2 graduate student writers , and they also do not show inappropriate use of informal conjunctions in the formal context . These position them closer to the two scholar groups . For the function of Time connections , L1 student writers differ from the other groups : L2 student writers primarily use Time to show the chronological sequence of events , which goes against the purposes of academic writing ; the two scholar groups use Time primarily to show information organization . L1 student writers are in between and they use Time to show both functions fairly frequently .

In general , people working together on an engineering project should have a substantial agreement on goals ( such as whether profit is the dominant objective ) and values ( such as attitude toward risk ) . If such agreement is in place , differences of opinion on an engineering team can frequently be settled based on facts . Because of this , engineering decisions may converge as knowledge is shared and evidence is accumulated . In other words , we agree with Scott and Antonsson ( 1999 ) that there exists a well - defined aggregated order among alternatives and that the availability of this order depends on ' ' time and resources '' .

"Demand Response ( DR ) provides both operational and financial benefits to a variety of stakeholders in the power system . For example , in the deregulated market operated by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas ( ERCOT ) , load serving entities ( LSEs ) usually purchase electricity from the wholesale market ( either in ahead or real - time market ) and sign fixed retail price contracts with their . Therefore , incentivizing end - consumers ' load shift from peak to off - peak hours could benefit the LSE in terms of reducing its purchase of electricity under high prices from the real- time market . As the of - its - kind implementation of Coupon Incentive - based Demand Response ( CIDR ) , the EnergyCoupon project provides end - consumers with dynamic time - of - use DR event announcements , individualized load reduction targets with EnergyCoupons as the incentive for meeting these targets , as well as periodic lotteries using these coupons as lottery tickets for winning dollar- value gifts . A number of methodologies are developed for this special type of DR program including price / baseline prediction , individualized target setting and a lottery mechanism . This paper summarizes the methodologies , design , critical findings , as well as the potential generalization of such an experiment . Comparison of the EnergyCoupon with a conventional - Use ( TOU ) price - based DR program is also conducted . Experimental results in the year 2017 show that by combining dynamic coupon offers with periodic lotteries , the effective cost for demand response providers in EnergyCoupon can be substantially reduced , while achieving a similar level of demand reduction as conventional DR programs .",Demand Response,0,2,demand response providers,268,271,no relation found

"Compared with common shipboard power networks and land distribution power grids , the floating nuclear power plant grid is compact in structure , and because of the ship hull being used as the ground loop , it is prone to generating different fault forms . Moreover , the reactor loads in the floating nuclear power plant are sensitive to large ground fault current . Thus , the protection method should have high sensitivity to different ground faults . To solve the problems , a protection method in cooperation with the multi-mode grounding control is proposed in this paper . When a ground fault occurs , if the fault current is larger than the threshold value , the system remains grounded with high . The protection method based on WTMM is used , and MUEER is defined to select the optimal wavelet basis and decomposition scale . When HIFs occur , the fault characteristics of the feeders are not obvious because of the signal noise and the limited precision of zero-sequence CT . Under such conditions , multi-mode grounding control is adopted and the system is switched into low-resistance grounding mode to enlarge the fault characteristic . A phase difference protection method based on zero-sequence current mutation and fault phase voltage mutation before and after the fault is applied . The performance of the proposed scheme is verified by simulation .",the reactor loads,47,50,HIFs,147,148,no relation found

"The role of quench rate after the solution treatment on the plastic flow and fracture of three aluminium alloys was studied by conducting tensile tests on smooth and V-notched specimens as well as Kahn tear tests . The three AlMgSi alloys considered , i.e. , 6060 , 6082.25 and 6082.50 , had different grain structure , grain size and crystallographic texture . The alloys were differently affected by the quench rate , as obtained by water - quenching or air . The TEM study showed that air - cooling is detrimental for precipitation in all alloys . In lean alloys , like the 6060 alloy , the detrimental effect is due to an overall reduction in precipitate number density and slightly coarser precipitates . In dense alloys that contain dispersoids , like the 6082 alloys , PFZs around the dispersoids become much wider after air . If the density of dispersoids is high and the grain size is small , such as in the 6082.25 alloy , the PFZs of adjacent dispersoids overlap , and due to the small grain and subgrain size in this material , entire grains can become free of precipitates . If the density of dispersoids is low and the grain size is relatively large , as in the 6082.50 alloy , PFZs around dispersoids do not necessarily overlap , resulting in an inhomogenous microstructure consisting of strong regions of dense preciptiation a certain distance from dispersoids that are surrounded by wide PFZs . gave consistently larger precipitate free zones around both GBs and dispersoids in the three alloys than water - quenching .",adjacent dispersoids,170,172,smooth and V-notched specimens,26,30,no relation found
"We have introduced customizable MFs as cell mimics that have a natural membrane and cytosol interior combined with AOs that produce desired molecules or signals . Preformed polymersomes taken up by the donor cells are transferred into hybrid giant plasma membrane vesicles , , where they preserve their integrity and move along the membrane to give a multicompartment cell - like architecture ; membrane stability of the is improved by insertion of polymers . In addition , polymersomes loaded with catalytic compounds , such as enzymes , play the role of AOs and support in situ reactions inside MFs . Compared to previously reported artificial cells based on bottom - up approaches , our MFs represent an advance in terms of complexity ( given by the intrinsic composition of GPMVs supplemented by transfer ) and functionality ( supported by in situ enzymatic reactions inside AOs ) that has been proven in vivo . Such MFs open new avenues for understanding bioreactions and functions in a close - to-nature environment . In addition , by systematic optimization of the conditions in which MFs are produced , it is possible to control the amount of synthetic cargoes with which these artificial cells are equipped . This control can be used to favor a specific interaction , reinforce stability , or tune the overall efficiency of the reactions inside the AOs , as an essential step towards medical applications . Further , our experiments with ZFEs show that these MFs are nontoxic , and can successfully persist in vivo while retaining their integrity and functionality . Such MFs are developed in a straightforward manner that can be easily scaledup , and thus have potential for development of highly efficient in vitro diagnostic and in vivo therapeutic solutions depending on the specificity of the enzymes loaded inside the AOs .",the conditions,177,179,their integrity,47,49,no relation found

It is also shown that the maximum energy absorption part of the aluminum tube passing the quasi-static three - point test is also here . Similarly , it is also found that with the increase of , the energy absorption in the middle part of the aluminum tube becomes more and more uneven and the stress becomes more and more unbalanced . When the ratio of is 12.48 , the energy absorption type of the circular empty aluminum tube is the most uniform . It can also be known from the simulation diagram that with an increase of ratio , the crosssectional area of its main energy absorbing surface becomes narrower and narrower . This shows that energy absorption is becoming more and more obvious . The simulation analysis also found that the predicted deformation behavior characteristic trend is similar to the test , and the average coefficient of variation is less than 3 . Finally , the simulation results are analyzed through experiments and discussed in combination with the theory . With the increase of the aluminum tube 's diameter , the flat width increases and the depression depth increases , and the greater the damage , the greater the capacity absorption , and the greater the SEA . However , when the ratio gradually increases , the greater the displacement , the greater the PCF value generated .

This paper presents design of an self contained actuators unit in wide area damping control of power system in stabilizing system response for both nominal system condition and during actuator faults . First it is presented that use of multiple actuators in wide area control aid in improving damping in power system . A wide area damping controller feeding multiple actuators to satisfy multiple objectives in wide area damping control of power system is designed . Minimization of infinity norm of closed loop transfer function of power system with wide area controller in feedback path & closed loop poles placement techniques are used in controller synthesis . Second a reconfigurable control on the lines of fault hiding principle is added to the controller design to maintain system damping to pre-fault level in case of actuator faults . A reconfiguration component ( RC ) is activated on occurrence of actuator fault thereby reconfiguring system dynamics and redistributing wide area control signal among remaining active actuators . RC together with remaining active actuators and under same wide area damping controller maintains system damping to pre-fault level thereby preserving system dynamic response . In the reconfigurable control design presented here no new actuators outside the unit of actuators designed for wide area damping control is required . This makes for an self contained actuators unit in wide area damping control of power system both for nominal system condition and for system affected by actuator faults . A two area power system model is considered here for demonstrating effectiveness of designed robust damping controller with multiple outputs feeding multiple actuators in wide area control and illustrating the idea of self contained actuators unit for maintaining system damping in case of actuator faults .,controller,57,58,pre-fault level,129,131,A reconfigurable control is added to the controller design to maintain system damping to pre-fault level.

As an approximate solution to this , the genre analysis is based exclusively on orthographic words containing "" nano "" as an initial or sole element ( i.e. , "" nano * "" ) . The rationale for this maneuver is twofold . First , nano is overwhelmingly used as an initial constituent of complex words ( as we will see below ) . The search expression "" nano * "" will therefore capture most of the wider search expression "" * nano * "" . Second , in comparison with the restriction made ( i.e. , "" "" ) , extending the search to all orthographic words containing "" nano "" ( i.e. , "" * nano * "" ) would add many more irrelevant uses to the genre analysis than relevant ones .",the genres,8,10,an initial or sole element,56,61,"The analysis of the genres is based on words containing "" nano "" as an initial or sole element."
"Applying the PPU theory to the case of toiuka , I would like to propose that the shift from the UI position to the LP position was caused by the presence of a long stretch of utterance before toiuka . When the speaker attempts to reformulate such a long stretch of utterance , it is more likely that the end of a PPU comes before toiuka . This is because a long phrase or clause is more likely to be marked by a PPU boundary . In contrast , when toiuka replaces a word or a short phrase , it is less likely that the end of a PPU comes before the insertion of toiuka . In the same vein , when the speaker knows , ahead of time , that the expression to be used is not exactly what he / she wants to say , toiuka will be inserted right after the expression and show his / her hesitation toward its wording . In such a case , both the expression and toiuka will be within the same PPU . Moreover , the speaker is likely to use the toiuka Sequence with some mitigating expression . However , if the speaker , for some reason , noticed the inappropriateness of what he / she has said after the completion of the PPU , then a PPU boundary will appear before toiuka . In such an instance of afterthought , toiuka will not have a connotation of hesitation , and it will be most likely to take the Single-toiuka Sequence . One may say that this kind of noticing through self - monitoring eventually made toiuka a repair preface . As the Repair Use and the Single-toiuka Sequence of UI toiuka become more entrenched , the scope of the utterance being reformulated has become wider . Consequently , the speaker comes to reformulate the utterance with more options other than simply providing a replacement , and this probably has led to the emergence of the Upgrade Use . This postulated scenario of change , however , needs to be confirmed with more narrowly transcribed data that accurately keep track of changes in intonation and lengths of pauses .",change,343,344,hesitation,160,161,no relation found

"In conclusion , we propose a family of new 2D materials - the monolayer dialkali-metal monoxides with the structure . These materials enjoy good stability and excellent flexibility .

They may host a range of fascinating physical effects such as universal optical absorbance , super Klein tunneling , and super collimation effect . Furthermore , rich topological phase transitions can be achieved in these materials by strain . Under biaxial strain , a series of transitions can be realized . Under uniaxial strain , the double Weyl point can be split into a pair of single Weyl ( Dirac ) points , accompanied with the transition from weak localization to weak antilocalization in quantum transport property . In addition , this phase is a 2D topological insulator state when SOC is included .

"Based on an ethnographic fieldwork experience among two culturally different ethnic groups in Ethiopia , this article proposes an understanding of social roles in the field in a continuum . The two groups are known as Gumuz and Agaw . In my fieldwork with the Gumuz , I was an "" outsider "" and the Gumuz social boundary did not allow me to socialize unless through a certain institution known as mijim . In my fieldwork with the Agaw , I was an insider because I was born and grew up among this community . The Agaw social boundary was so open and , contrary to the Gumuz , I had to resist social roles . I propose that arguments that are advocated by scholars on extreme sides of taking or refusing social roles based on perceived advantages or disadvantages are untenable .

"If we focus on the two approach , RF produces an average error of 3.9 percent for the tasks composing the Povray workflow . For the Blender workflow , the average RAE increases up to 5.25 percent , while for Wien2 k and Montage the RAE is 6.64 and 8.97 percent , respectively . Therefore , the average RAE over all workflow tasks is always less than 10 percent , for each of the analyzed cases when the two approach is used in combination with RF . If we examine individual workflow tasks , the minimum achieved RAE has been 1.6 percent for one of the tasks of Povray workflow , while the maximum has been 12.2 percent for one of the Montage tasks . Our approach has not been able to provide a RAE value below 10 percent for five of the analysed task . Interestingly , these tasks belong to one out of the following two groups : ( 1 ) tasks with very short execution times ( less than a second ) ; or ( 2 ) tasks which are bandwidth dependent . Tasks belonging to the first group are hard to predict since even small overheads ( such as instrumentation overhead ) can account for a substantial percentage of the final execution time . Tasks in the second group are influenced by the time to download / upload data from / to the internet , which fluctuates with the available bandwidth . When comparing our two -stage approach against singlestage approaches regardless of the regression method , our experiment show that the former is better than the latter for all cases when considering all workflow tasks ( see average reported RAE for each workflow ) . The only case where single - stage approaches and our proposal are comparable ( i.e. , they computed similar RAE values ) is when the twostage approach uses LR as regression method .",the average RAE,29,32,the analyzed cases,73,76,The average RAE is always less than 10 percent for each of the analyzed cases.
"Recall - based power priming is a popular research design that is widely disliked by Amazon Mechanical Turk ( MTurk ) workers . This article assesses the potential consequences of such displeasure through a conceptual replication of Fast et al. on MTurk . Specifically , this article assesses the extent to which recall - based priming can elicit a sense of high power and positive emotion . Findings indicate that being primed with a sense of high power through recall does not elicit the expected positive change in emotion . Findings also indicate that recall - based priming is a less effective manipulation of power than an alternative priming method with which participants were more willing to participate . Unlike the recall - based prime , this alternative prime also replicated Fast et al . 's original findings . These results are attributed to the incompatibility between feeling powerful and participating in a disliked study design .

Our study was carried out by forming two school groups according to their academic success . The effects of school culture on the two variables were investigated because they were represented by two observed variables , namely high - performing school and low-performing school . Both quantitative and qualitative data showed that teachers ' perceptions of school culture in high - performing schools were very strong compared to low-performing schools . We can claim that as teachers ' perceptions of school culture increase , students ' average academic achievement score increases , too .

Automatizing such a capability has therefore increasingly driven multidisciplinary research for the past decades . At the heart of this issue are very challenging signal processing and artificial intelligence problems driven by the inherent complexity of human affect . We therefore propose a principled framework for designing automated systems capable of continuously estimating the human affective state from an incoming stream of images . First , we model human affect as a dynamical system and define the affective state in terms of valence , arousal and their higher - order derivatives . We then pose the affective state estimation problem as a Bayesian filtering problem and provide a solution based on Kalman filtering ( KF ) for probabilistic reasoning over time , combined with multiple instance sparse Gaussian processes ( MI - SGP ) for inferring affect - related measurements from image sequences . We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate our proposed framework on the AVEC 2012 and AVEC 2014 benchmark datasets and obtain state - of - the - art results using the baseline features as input to our - KF model .

"Age hardenable aluminium alloys are widely used , such as in car body panels , aeroplane fuselages , and in load - bearing components for structural applications . High strength and ductility are typically desired for practical applications , and aluminium alloys are attractive due to their high load - bearing capacity and low weight . In addition , properties such as good formability and corrosion resistance , combined with a great potential for recycling , make them appealing to , e.g. , the automotive and offshore industry . The thermo-mechanical processing of age hardenable aluminium alloys influences microstructural characteristics such as the grain structure , crystallographic texture and precipitate structure . Thus , by changing the chemical composition , heat treatment and mechanical processing , one can control the yield stress , work hardening and plastic anisotropy of the alloy . While this flexibility is desired , it can also give rise to processing related issues such as quench sensitivity .",corrosion,65,66,load - bearing components,20,24,no relation found

For some simple mechanical mechanism , the expressions of stress in fragile region can be easily obtained . This kind of problem can establish explicit limit state function . However , for complex mechanical structures , some software such as finite element analysis software is needed . The implicit limit state function problem is caused by the difficulty in deriving the expression from the formula .

Economic development based on resource extraction , from an Indigenous perspective , comes with a price that is too high . Although some communities choose to engage in the extraction business , others refuse to , based on their traditional obligations to the land . To allow development on traditional territories , there is a need to reaffirm inherent rights as a culture and a nation to maintain stewardship of the land . This does not necessarily mean that they seek independent sovereignty . For some communities , this means they want to be a part of Canada , including its economy and remain under Canadian citizenship and laws . However , they want agreements to allow them to determine their own future as a participating and equal partner - nation within Canada . Many leaders , including Chief Yellowhead , want to be actively involved in decision - making for their own communities .

"Structural systems often exhibit time - varying dynamic characteristics during their service life due to serve hazards and environmental erosion , so the identification of time - varying structural systems is an important research topic . Among the previous methodologies , wavelet multiresolution analysis for time - varying structural systems has gained increasing attention in the past decades . However , most of the existing wavelet - based identification approaches request the full measurements of structural responses including acceleration , velocity , and displacement responses at all dynamic degrees of freedom . In this article , an improved algorithm is proposed for the identification of time - varying structural parameters using only partial measurements of structural acceleration responses . The proposed algorithm is based on the synthesis of wavelet multiresolution decomposition and the Kalman filter approach . The time - varying structural stiffness and damping parameters are expanded at multi-scale profile by wavelet multiresolution decomposition , so the time - varying parametric identification problem is converted into a time - invariant one . Structural full responses are estimated by Kalman filter using partial observations of structural acceleration responses . The scale coefficients by the wavelet expansion are estimated via the solution of a nonlinear optimization problem of minimizing the errors between estimated and observed accelerations . Finally , the original time - varying parameters can be reconstructed . To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm , the identification of several numerical examples with various time - varying scenarios is studied .",Structural full responses,173,176,the full measurements,71,74,The structural full responses are estimated for the full measurements.

"This study was concerned with representing the functional product architecture ( physical organisations of parts in a component to satisfy the functions ) for an integrated product considering alternative manufacturing options . For integrated products , conventional architecture representations such as DSMs ( Design Structure Matrices ) or node link diagrams are insufficient in indicating how the product satisfies the functions required of it since the matrices have only one element in it , as is the case when using a fully integrated component such as a complex casting . To solve the representation problem , it was proposed that each manufactured segment of the product ( such as a cast segment ) be associated with a generalised function and a generalised section . Generalised functions ( GFs ) are the collection of all functions that a class of products are typically required to satisfy . Generalised sections ( GSs ) are the collection of all regions present in different products that contribute to satisfying the functions . Since the same manufactured segment of the product is associated with generalised functions and generalised sections , a GF - GS mapping can be created from a set composition operation and represented in a graph . The GFs and GSs form the nodes and relations between GSs and GFs form the edges of the graph . In addition to the approach that associates manufactured segments to GFs and GSs , an enhanced function - means ( EF - M ) tree for the components was created so that already existing design knowledge can be included in the architecture representation . Graphs can then be generated from the axiomatic design matrix ( iibmatrix ) for the EF - tree which is similar to the initially created graph but with more refined functions to sections to relationships in it .",Generalised sections,146,148,the product,56,58,Generalised sections the regions present in the product that satisfy the functions.

"The water - meter shell has a complex-structured thin - walled cavity , and it can cause casting defects such as shrinkage and misrun . On the basis of structural analysis of a water - meter shell , a three - dimensional model and a finite element model of the water - meter shell were constructed using the SOLIDWORKS and ProCAST software as a modeling tool and a casting numerical simulation tool , respectively . Three processes associated with the bottom gating system without a riser , a step gating system with a preliminary riser , and a step gating system with an optimum riser were successively numerically simulated . The mold - filling sequence , temperature distribution , liquid - phase distribution during solidification , and shrinkage distribution of these three processes are discussed here . The numerical simulation results indicated that optimization of the casting process and the rational assembling of the riser led to the shrinkage volumes at the inlet position , regulating sleeve , and sealing ring of the water - meter shell decreasing from 0.68 to 0 cm 3 , 1.39 to 0.22 cm 3 , and 1.32 to 0.23 cm 3 , respectively .

"Structural systems often exhibit time - varying dynamic characteristics during their service life due to serve hazards and environmental erosion , so the identification of time - varying structural systems is an important research topic . Among the previous methodologies , wavelet multiresolution analysis for time - varying structural systems has gained increasing attention in the past decades . However , most of the existing wavelet - based identification approaches request the full measurements of structural responses including acceleration , velocity , and displacement responses at all dynamic degrees of freedom . In this article , an improved algorithm is proposed for the identification of time - varying structural parameters using only partial measurements of structural acceleration responses . The proposed algorithm is based on the synthesis of wavelet multiresolution decomposition and the Kalman filter approach . The time - varying structural stiffness and damping parameters are expanded at multi-scale profile by wavelet multiresolution decomposition , so the time - varying parametric identification problem is converted into a time - invariant one . Structural full responses are estimated by Kalman filter using partial observations of structural acceleration responses . The scale coefficients by the wavelet expansion are estimated via the solution of a nonlinear optimization problem of minimizing the errors between estimated and observed accelerations . Finally , the original time - varying parameters can be reconstructed . To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm , the identification of several numerical examples with various time - varying scenarios is studied .",The scale coefficients,189,192,service life,11,13,no relation found

"There is a strong social role expectation of mutual support among the persons in mijim relationship . A general trend is that an "" outsider "" would present the Gumuz cloths , salt , and any other items which are not found in the Gumuz culture or market to the Gumuz mijim counterpart . This is how the highland "" modern "" culture and social activities , such as those mentioned just above , spread to the Gumuz lowlanders . On the contrary , the Gumuz mijim would usually give land to his mijim . Following ethnic federalism in 1995 , one of the contestations by the Gumuz against the shuwa , in general , and the Agaw , in particular , is that the latter has possessed the Gumuz land by taking advantage of the mijim relationship . This does not mean that the mijim relationship was just founded on economic interests . In the case of war and insecurity , the Agaw and the Gumuz mijims had to protect each other . For example , an informant to Amsalu ( 2016 ) stated , . . . . the Gumuz family brought their children to the Agaw [ mijim ] home when they were nominated for enslaving . The holes were dug in the coop with the size and length of the proposed slaves . The wooden planks were placed over them . Over the plunks , the place was cooped and the goats and sheep were kept over it . When the raiders come , they check the entire home to find the fugitives .

But they were even positively interpreted , and one would enjoy the Gumuz teaching social roles to an apprentice mijim . The relationship also offered me protection from any risk of getting attacked by other Gumuz villagers . The mijim would be around me during the fieldwork , introducing me throughout villages and offering me security .

"The adaptive motion - based strategy performance degrades in the EWMA prediction scenario as it directly computes a sampling duty cycle based on movement and energy forecasts , which both include uncertainty . Although the same forecasts are also used by the adaptive information - based strategy to compute the dynamic error threshold , employing dead - reckoning to estimate the instantaneous trajectory error to decide on sampling yields significant benefits . Interestingly , EWMA prediction yields a slightly higher median error for adaptive information - based sampling than for the scenario with separated harvesting and tracking . We attribute this effect to hidden constructive interaction between the uncertainties in mobility and energy prediction . Furthermore , the variance in the daily tracking error for informationbased sampling in the EWMA scenario is slightly higher than for the separated scenario , highlighting the effect of uncertainty in the energy budget on the tracking performance .",the same forecasts,34,37,uncertainty,31,32,no relation found
"Engineering designers frequently use prototypes to gather input from stakeholders . Design guidelines recommend the use of quick and simple prototypes early and often in a design process . However , the type and quality of a prototype can influence how stakeholders perceive a new design concept and can , therefore , impact their responses . Additionally , different levels of experience , expertise , and preparedness for providing input to designers may lead stakeholders from different geographical or cultural settings to provide different responses , making the format of a prototype even more influential . Although design practitioners are known to intentionally align their prototyping approaches with the specific design question to be answered , it is unclear the extent to which prototyping approaches should vary based on the stakeholder , context , and setting of a design project . To investigate how the format and quality of prototypes influence stakeholders ' responses , we conducted a field study with various medical professionals in Ghana . We presented prototypes for a medical device in different formats to stakeholders and collected responses to the design through semi-structured interviews . Our findings indicate that professional expertise , prototype format , and question type influenced the types of responses that stakeholders provided .

Participants also gained greater confidence in their ability to achieve their goals and plan different alternatives to solve their problems . Although perceptions of social support from the community were high prior to the intervention , after the program participants reported even stronger feelings of belonging and more willingness to participate in community activities and organizations . Consequently , participants claimed to have more trust in the people within their environment as a source of instrumental and emotional support . This greater degree of confidence also extended to institutions and social organizations operating outside the boundaries of participants ' own communities .

"This study conducted an investigation on transverse quasi-static three - point loading on a circular aluminum tube and its characteristic plastic failure and energy - absorption behaviors . The thin wall thickness of the aluminum tube , the various diameter and thickness ratios ( ) of the tube , and the tube length are important control parameters . Experimental data for different span length and thickness ratios of the tube were characterized and correlated to its plastic collapse behavior . A simulation model by computational analysis using ANSYS was also conducted as a comparative study . The results of the study found that transverse three - point bend loading ( ASTM F290 ) of a circular aluminum tube underwent different stages of deformation , from initial pure crumpling to crumpling and bending , and finally , structural rupture . The results of master curve analysis found that regions of high energy absorption and low energy absorption can be classified with respect to the characteristic tubular deformation . High energy absorption deformation is correlated with a short span length and higher ratio , and vice versa for low energy absorption deformation of the circular aluminum tube . Simulation analysis also predicted similar characteristic trends of deformation behavior in the experiment , with a less than 3 average coefficient of variation .",the aluminum tube,33,36,respect,160,161,Results showed that the aluminum tube energy absorption can be classified with respect to the deformation.

"This work has demonstrated how symmetry - aware mapping of logic functions onto FPGA architectures in combination with evolutionary algorithms can be a powerful tool devising fault- blind repair strategies using existing reconfiguration mechanisms . This paper has focussed on faultmitigation in the case of transistor failures .

The approach presented here can be generalised to any existing FPGA architecture that exhibits regularities and symmetries in its architecture . Future work will be considering the more unique features of PAnDA that go beyond what currently available FPGAs can do , which is reconfiguration at the transistor level , in order to extend hierarchical fault- mitigation to this lower level and to expand the scope of fault tolerance towards design optimisation .

"This method allows us to divide the flow field into several subdomains and then generate grid blocks for each subdomain . The different grid blocks can overlap , nest or cover each other , thus reducing the difficulty of the grid generation process and compensating for the poor adaptability of the structural grid to the actual shape . The core technique of the approach involves the blocks ' ' digging holes ' ' in each other to establish the connections between the grid blocks . When applied to the flow problem of multi-body relative motion , these grid blocks have relative motion , and it is thus necessary to apply the overset grid technique at each time step to establish the connection relationships between these grid blocks and to transmit the boundary information from the interface required for the flow field calculations in each region . The overset grid technique consists of three steps : digging holes , searching for contribution units and interpolation .",the approach,62,64,the connections,78,80,The approach involves the blocks ' ' digging holes ' ' in each other to establish the connections between the grid blocks .

To achieve this , we analyzed the variables that influence the inspection process in , and we structured our Flash Translation Layer ( FTL ) to eliminate the latencies generated by the computation of the Error Correcting Codes ( ECC ) and redundancy bytes .

"There is a strong social role expectation of mutual support among the persons in mijim relationship . A general trend is that an "" outsider "" would present the Gumuz cloths , salt , and any other items which are not found in the Gumuz culture or market to the Gumuz mijim counterpart . This is how the highland "" modern "" culture and social activities , such as those mentioned just above , spread to the Gumuz lowlanders . On the contrary , the Gumuz mijim would usually give land to his mijim . Following ethnic federalism in 1995 , one of the contestations by the Gumuz against the shuwa , in general , and the Agaw , in particular , is that the latter has possessed the Gumuz land by taking advantage of the mijim relationship . This does not mean that the mijim relationship was just founded on economic interests . In the case of war and insecurity , the Agaw and the Gumuz mijims had to protect each other . For example , an informant to Amsalu ( 2016 ) stated , . . . . the Gumuz family brought their children to the Agaw [ mijim ] home when they were nominated for enslaving . The holes were dug in the coop with the size and length of the proposed slaves . The wooden planks were placed over them . Over the plunks , the place was cooped and the goats and sheep were kept over it . When the raiders come , they check the entire home to find the fugitives . They check for all corners and went back without finding one who had been hidden in the coop hole . They [ the Agaw mijim ] also used to hide the children in a granary , bed floor , and other secret places . ( 96 ) As a researcher who was able to establish a mijim relationship , I fulfilled expectations by buying clothes and small food items such as salt and sugar to the Gumuz family with whom I created the relationship . The Gumuz mijim also invited me to his home , and I enjoyed foods and drinks offered to me abundantly . The relationship would become full of gifts and caring . What matters was not the size of a gift , but how to learn to respond . This does not mean that some violations of role expectations did not occur . But they were even positively interpreted , and one would enjoy the Gumuz teaching social roles to an apprentice mijim . The relationship also offered me protection from any risk of getting attacked by other Gumuz villagers . The mijim would be around me during the fieldwork , introducing me throughout villages and offering me security . In a few weeks , I enjoyed the relationship with the Gumuz during the fieldwork , growing from a mere shuwa to a mijim . The relationship offered openness for interviews not only with the mijim themselves but also with other Gumuz interviewees whom I was introduced through my mijim .",The relationship,374,376,the Gumuz mijims,165,168,The relationship would become full of caring after the Gumuz mijims invited me to their home.
"When it comes to supporting function modelling in practice , it seems that two different schools of thought exist . The first school entails scholars working towards a clearly formalised description of function , eventually with the hope of establishing a ( somewhat ) computational function model . The aim behind these and similar endeavours is to provide unambiguous models , thereby facilitating clarity in modelling and , in extension , in communicating about them . The second school of thought is more inclined to look at how designers usually work with and draw benefit from function modelling in practice . These latter scholars typically highlight that function taxonomies and ontologies , by the large majority of practitioners , are perceived as too abstract to provide them with concrete support in finding solutions to given problems . Related empirical research suggests that practitioners tend to work around formalised approaches or apply them less rigorously . In some cases , shared comprehension in design teams was in fact found to increase when natural language is used ( see .",endeavours,54,55,function modelling,5,7,The aim behind these and similar endeavours is to provide unambiguous function modelling.

"Accurate spelling is a fundamental skill for effective written communication . It is regarded to be a predominant goal of literacy since spelling errors may significantly change the meaning of the words or sentences . Spelling skill implicates legitimate phonetic , morphemic and orthographic formations that require appropriate awareness levels of the language rules and structure . But if the linguistic rules are complex or irregular and the literacy context is diglossic or even tri-or , the ability to accurately spell words is expected to be limited . This paper accounts for the spelling skill of one certain consonant in one specific position , i.e. the hamzah consonant in its middle position , and presents the challenges that might be encountered by Arabic learners in a high educational level . The current study aimed specifically at providing an insight into the spelling proficiency of two groups of college students in Kuwait , hearing and orally - educated deaf , who are undertaking four- year teaching preparation programs in different educational disciplines . The spelling stimuli was balanced for lexical familiarity and the data analysis accounted for the effect of orthographic , phonological and morphological aspects of the hamzah on the spelling outcome . Results indicated that hearing and deaf college students experienced difficulty in attaining all written forms of middle hamzah , but the most and least common errors showed a general tendency to follow the phonological route of phoneme-graphene conversion when spelling . Unfamiliarity with the governing rules of hamzah was also evident since a higher percentage of errors occurred in spelling low-frequency words despite following the regular spelling rules of hamzah . The irregularity and complex orthographic and morphemic rules of hamzah as well as the variability in the acoustic production of hamzah sounds are discussed in light of the multi-glossic context of Arabic .",the hamzah consonant,105,108,deaf college students,208,211,The hamzah consonant was difficult to write for deaf college students.
"This paper proposed a new memory disaggregation system backed by RDMA - supported high bandwidth networks . The proposed hypervisor - based design for disaggregated memory provides memory extension to the remote memory transparently to guest operating systems and applications . Its new design proposed a new replacement scheme , overlapped memory reclaim and network transfer , and scalability supports by per-vCPU data structures and lockless writeback operations . In addition , the elastic block maximizes the performance benefit of exploiting the spatial locality , as it dynamically adapts to changing access patterns . The experimental results showed that the disaggregated memory can provide on average 6 percent performance degradation compared to the ideal local - memory only machine , even though the direct memory capacity is only 50 percent of the total memory footprint . In addition , the proposed design provides scalable performance with increasing numbers of vCPUs . With the advent of high bandwidth non-volatile memory technologies , the proposed disaggregated memory will be able to expand its support for general hierarchical memory systems , such as conventional DRAM and new non-volatile memory . To prove its design flexibility , the paper also showed the preliminary performance evaluation with the new Optane SSD as the indirect memory .",scalability,58,59,the paper,193,195,no relation found

"Farmers ' knowledge , represented by adulthood and experiences in any farming , stimulated them to engage in intensive farming . Credit access and technology adoption played a substantial role in encouraging farmers to engage in agribusiness of chilli . Credit and technology should be available at the same time . Credit was used as operating capital in intensive farming , which was commonly higher than the conventional one . Adoption of improved technology led to high production and eventually increased welfare . The distance of marketplace , or agribusiness station , to farm location also contributed an important role . The closer the marketplace is to farming , the more likely are farmers going to engage in the chilli-based agribusiness . It is very sensible because farmers should sell the product in a fresh form . Chilli is perishable , and thus long delay in the transportation will reduce the quality of chilli . Traders or customers determined farmers ' intention to engage in intensive farming . The timely availability of traders ensured that the product is marketable . Engagement in agribusiness of chilli was indirectly influenced by market information and the use of the telephone through the mediation of technology and credit . The role of the telephone was indirectly significant via the mediation of farmers ' access to credit and technology adoption , which was also dependent on other exogenous factors .

"For corporations , simply engaging with a community in dialogue is not enough .

Many Indigenous people in Canada are leveraging their inherent rights to land use and land claims to further their and self - sufficiency goals , that is , to protect and have stewardship over the land and its resources .

Economic development based on resource extraction , from an Indigenous perspective , comes with a price that is too high . Although some communities choose to engage in the extraction business , others refuse to , based on their traditional obligations to the land . To allow development on traditional territories , there is a need to reaffirm inherent rights as a culture and a nation to maintain stewardship of the land . This does not necessarily mean that they seek independent sovereignty . For some communities , this means they want to be a part of Canada , including its economy and remain under Canadian citizenship and laws .

"Smartwatches enable many novel applications and are fast gaining popularity . However , the presence of a diverse set of onboard sensors provides an additional attack surface to malicious software and services on these devices . In this paper , we investigate the feasibility of key press inference attacks on handheld numeric touchpads by using smartwatch motion sensors as a side - channel . We consider different typing scenarios , and propose multiple attack approaches to exploit the characteristics of the observed wrist movements for inferring individual key presses . Experimental evaluation using commercial off-the-shelf smartwatches and smartphones show that key press inference using smartwatch motion sensors is not only fairly accurate , but also comparable with similar attacks using smartphone motion sensors . Additionally , hand movements captured by a combination of both smartwatch and smartphone motion sensors yields better inference accuracy than either device considered individually .",this paper,37,39,malicious software,28,30,"In this paper, the presence of a diverse set of onboard sensors provides an additional attack surface to malicious software."
"Coefficient of friction , contact area between shoe and friction disk , shoe thickness , shoe density , shoe elastic modulus , and braking pressure were selected as random variables . During the braking process , the coefficient of friction also changes due to the combined effects of surface temperature , heat dissipation , friction surface flatness , particles , and so on . Therefore , the friction coefficient is selected as one of random variables . In the process of brake shoe production , it is difficult to guarantee the complete homogeneity of each brake shoe and the complete consistency of material properties . At the same time , the material properties will fluctuate slightly under the influence of external conditions , so the density and elastic modulus are selected as two random variables . During the braking process , due to deviation or equipment aging , the brake shoe surface and the brake disk surface cannot be completely parallel , which will lead to different degrees of reduction in the contact area of the friction pair . Therefore , the contact area between the brake shoe and the friction disk is selected as one of the random variables . Friction will lead to wear and tear of brake shoes to some extent , which means the thickness will reduce . Due to the slight difference in material properties between different brake shoes , the wear degree of the same batch of brake shoes may be different , so the thickness of brake shoes is selected as one of the random variables . Because of the vibration and the stability of the disk spring , the braking pressure will fluctuate to some extent , so the braking pressure is chosen as a random variable .",the disk spring,272,275,the thickness,217,219,no relation found

Although a general rightward asymmetry of TPJ was observed in the false - belief task , we found no difference between the left and right stimulation in the group level tDCS effect , suggesting the involvement of bilateral TPJ in social processing . Moreover , individual difference analysis revealed that a weak level of right lateralization favored stronger positive neurostimulation responsiveness , even for the right TPJ stimulation . A further analysis using hierarchical cluster analysis identified two groups : the positive responders and the negative responders . The positive responders , who benefited from both left and right stimulation , had a lower level of right lateralization , which was attributed to stronger activation in the left TPJ , and scoring higher on the social phobia scale than the negative responders . Moreover , the positive responders showed weaker functional coupling between the IPL part of TPJ and the medial superior frontal gyrus , which mediated the prediction of offline neurostimulation responsiveness by lateralization index .",The current study,0,3,the right TPJ stimulation,87,91,The current study investigates the right TPJ stimulation.
"The analysis of Pugh Controlled Convergence enables insights into the role of economics and social choice theory as tools for understanding engineering decision making . These theories make assumptions that do n't always map well into engineering . For example , Saari and Sieberg 's analysis of election procedures assumes each person 's stated preference ordering deserves equal consideration . This seems appropriate in a democratic election , but not so appropriate in engineering . Imagine a scenario in which an engineer believes , based on her expertise , that a particular concept is weak and a voting process results in the team selecting that concept . If the dissenting individual based her judgment on facts not known to the others , it provides little comfort that the voting process ensures that her opinion was weighted just as much as every other expert 's opinion . We suggest that it would be better to spend time discussing , in concrete engineering terms , her reasons for holding her opinion rather than investing that same time in a process that prevents the distorting effects of Condorcet cycles .

Moreover , branch swaps will be more complex due to the requirement to check - and possibly swap - the order of the CTs , if the input multiplexer configurations differ . Hence , when calculating the cost of an operation the power requirements are assumed to be higher for branch operations , despite the same number of CT reconfigurations are required .

"Accurate spelling is a fundamental skill for effective written communication . It is regarded to be a predominant goal of literacy since spelling errors may significantly change the meaning of the words or sentences . Spelling skill implicates legitimate phonetic , morphemic and orthographic formations that require appropriate awareness levels of the language rules and structure . But if the linguistic rules are complex or irregular and the literacy context is diglossic or even tri-or , the ability to accurately spell words is expected to be limited . This paper accounts for the spelling skill of one certain consonant in one specific position , i.e. the hamzah consonant in its middle position , and presents the challenges that might be encountered by Arabic learners in a high educational level . The current study aimed specifically at providing an insight into the spelling proficiency of two groups of college students in Kuwait , hearing and orally - educated deaf , who are undertaking four- year teaching preparation programs in different educational disciplines . The spelling stimuli was balanced for lexical familiarity and the data analysis accounted for the effect of orthographic , phonological and morphological aspects of the hamzah on the spelling outcome . Results indicated that hearing and deaf college students experienced difficulty in attaining all written forms of middle hamzah , but the most and least common errors showed a general tendency to follow the phonological route of phoneme-graphene conversion when spelling . Unfamiliarity with the governing rules of hamzah was also evident since a higher percentage of errors occurred in spelling low-frequency words despite following the regular spelling rules of hamzah . The irregularity and complex orthographic and morphemic rules of hamzah as well as the variability in the acoustic production of hamzah sounds are discussed in light of the multi-glossic context of Arabic .",the variability,287,289,the spelling outcome,199,202,no relation found

This study aims to introduce a method for the intuitive , easy , and quick specification of goal and transformation functions . The function specifications are constrained to a fixed grammar and vocabulary through which we aim to increase the uniqueness and clarity of function specifications and allow for the automated construction of a multi-domain - matrix ( MDM ) . The MDM consists of a component DSM , a function DSM , a parameter DSM , and three domain - mapping matrices ( DMMs ) indicating the dependencies between the elements in the three DSMs . The MDM provides valuable and structured information regarding the intended architecture of the system within the component , function , and parameter domains . In addition , by mapping parameter types onto dependencies types , a variety of distinct dependency types can be derived from the function specifications and visualized using the MDM . This reduces the required effort to construct high - definition DSMs .",DSMs,5,6,"the intuitive , easy , and quick specification",24,32,no relation found

In this article , a discrete - event simulation model is developed to investigate priority policies in design . The model explores the combined effects of progressive iteration , rework and change propagation during design of interconnected parts in a product architecture . Design progression is modelled as an increase in the maturity of parts ; rework and change propagation cause maturity levels in certain parts to reduce . Twelve product architecture models ranging in size from 7 to 32 elements are simulated to draw qualitative and general insights . Sensitivity of the findings to assumptions and model inputs is tested .

Meanwhile , the use of Saudi FA ( SFA ) as a suitable supplemental cementing material to partly substitute cement in the design of SFA - based concrete is highly imperative . An extensive experimental study was conducted to utilize increased levels of SFA in the production of concrete . Six concrete mixes were utilized : five out of the six mixes were made with different levels of SFA and one mix was used as a reference . This study presents the findings of using different volumes of SFA with variable proportions ( i.e. , 0 , 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 , and 50 ) .

However , the hardened strength properties and resistance to abrasion exhibited incessant and substantial enhancement at 56 days and up to one year , which is generally attributable to the pozzolanic reaction of SFA . Subsequently , all strengths increased when thermal heat decreased , and test results indicate that SFA can potentially substitute cement in concrete by up to 50 for the fabrication of structural concrete elements in the construction industry .",a suitable supplemental cementing material,78,83,landfills,22,23,a suitable supplemental cementing material is usually disposed in landfills.

"The impact of the real price of rice on the structural change process discussed above is likely to be at least partly dependent on its impact on the real wage . Thus , the empirical relationship between the real price of rice and the real wage needs to be explored . Data necessary to construct a sophisticated econometric model that would allow for the determination of the direction of causality and the elimination of endogeneity issues are not available . However , a simple model that seeks to determine if a relationship exists between the real price of rice and the real wage in manufacturing can be constructed . Similar to the estimation carried out for Equation ( 1 ) , before we can begin any empirical analysis , we have to first check for stationarity of the variables being considered given that they are time series variables . The augmented Dickey - Fuller test reveals that the real wage variable and the variable measuring rice price both have unit roots . First , differencing the real wage variable and second , differencing the rice price variable make these variables stationary . All variables utilized in the empirical analysis are stationary . The empirical analysis is based on performing a VAR estimation that is commonly utilized in multivariate time series analysis .

"Mat ern point processes of type II are well suited to model networks with carrier sensing for the following reasons : As opposed to Poisson cluster processes ( e.g. , Mat ern or Thomas cluster processes ) , a Mat ern hard - core process is introducing a minimum distance between each pair of concurrently sending nodes . By doing so , it avoids co-located nodes to send simultaneously similar to carrier sensing . Furthermore , due to its construction , Mat ern hard - core processes of type II are especially well suited to model medium access control , since the random nature of Mat ern thinning is realistically modeling the random selection of the nodes that are allowed to send . For example , when two co-located nodes try to send , the node sending first is selected due to random backoff leading to a different result every time this situation occurs .

"In this paper , we propose a novel method to predict the execution time of workflow tasks with varying input data . We model such execution times as functions that depend on workflow inputs as well as on cloud features . Such models are built using regression methods based on historical executions of that workflow in the cloud . Cloud features describe properties of the virtual machine ( VM ) type in which the task is executed . As a VM can be launched on different physical servers , resulting in different execution times , we also collect runtime information for different clouds . Our approach uses two stages of predictions to estimate the execution time of a task on a particular VM .",We,22,23,model,23,24,We model such execution times.

"Due to the tightening of requirements and the increasing complexity of products , robust design becomes more and more important in the context of a straightforward product development . Although various robust design methods have been evolved to support the design of products that are less sensitive to variations , these methods are not sufficiently integrated into early stages of the product development process . This is mainly due to the lack of concrete product data necessary for robustness evaluation and tolerance specification . For this reason , it is still unclear to product development engineers when and how to apply existing approaches for enhancing the robustness of products . Therefore , this paper describes a holistic methodology that supports the designer in developing a robust product layout including an initial , validated tolerance specification based on the functional requirements . The proposed framework focuses on the close linkage of robust design activities with product data along the product development process and demonstrates the resulting benefits of an early consideration of variations and tolerances . In addition to the proper choice of robust product concepts and their corresponding spatial arrangement in the product structure , the approach allows a conceptual tolerance specification and the subsequent CADbased analysis based on the preliminary design . Thus , the proposed approach aims to reduce iterations in the conventional tolerancing . To demonstrate the process , the methodology is applied to an electric window regulator .",their corresponding spatial arrangement,186,190,product data,74,76,no relation found

"The proof that the relation between subfunctions and functions cannot be formally one of parthood consists of showing that this relation does not meet the three basic mereological postulates 1 - 3 . For this proof , two categories of functions are introduced . The first category consists of token functions / modelled as transformations of tokens of flows , say , flows of energy , material or signals . With a token , flow is meant a specific flow that occurs only once . A token flow of electrical energy a , for instance , is a flow of energy that exists within one specific period in time and at one specific place in space . A second token flow of electrical energy a 0 may be a flow similar to a by having the same intensity and duration as a . But when this second flow a 0 occurs in another period or at another place than a , then a 0 is a token flow different to a . A token function / can now be represented by ordered sets hI , Oi , where I contains the input token flows to the function / and its output token flows . For instance , the token function / = ha , bi transforms the electrical energy token flow a to the rotational energy token flow The token function / 0 = ha 0 , b 0 i , which transforms the electrical energy token flow a 0 to the rotational energy token flow 0 , is then another token function than / = ha , bi as soon as a and a 0 are two different token flows , or b and 0 are two different token flows .",A token flow,85,88,in time,107,109,A token flow of electrical energy is a flow of energy that exists within one specific period in time.

"The yielding , plastic flow and fracture of age hardenable aluminium alloys depend on the quench rate to room temperature after the solution at elevated temperature and before the artificial ageing . We investigate three AlMgSi alloys with different grain structure and crystallographic texture experimentally to determine the effects of quench rate ( either water - quenching or air - cooling ) on the precipitate microstructure and the mechanical properties , i.e. , yield stress , work hardening and ductility . Tensile tests on smooth and Vnotch specimens and Kahn tear tests are performed to study the influence of stress state on plastic flow and fracture . In addition , finite element simulations of the mechanical tests are performed for one of the alloys to investigate the validity of an extension of the Gurson model to high - exponent anisotropic plasticity . Transmission electron microscopy investigations show that the alloys and their precipitation microstructure are differently affected by the quench rate . Common for the three alloys is that the precipitate free zones around dispersoids and grain boundaries become larger , and the yield strength of the alloys becomes lower , after air - cooling than after water - quenching . The nanostructure model NaMo was modified to account for precipitate free zones , and was able to predict both the precipitation parameters and the tensile yield strength of all tempers and materials with a reasonable degree of accuracy , except in one case . In this case , the inhomogeneous precipitation in the material is too complex to be captured by the inherent precipitation model in NaMo . Due to the lower yield strength and higher work - hardening rate after air - cooling , the failure strain is increased for the smooth and V-notch tensile tests . The crack propagation energy , calculated from the Kahn tear tests , is markedly affected by the quench rate and the effect is different depending on the grain structure and plastic anisotropy , caused by the crystallographic texture . The anisotropic porous plasticity model used in the finite element simulations is able to precisely capture the fracture initiation in all the specimen geometries of the considered alloy , whereas the crack propagation energies of the Kahn tear tests are slightly overestimated .",NaMo,204,205,either water - quenching,53,57,no relation found

"To overcome the limitations of the set composition - based , graph theoretical representation ( discussed in Sect .3.2 ) and to make use of already existing design knowledge with the designers , an EF - tree was created for the pump model , extending on the model created by the set composition . In this case , the function ' intercomponent attachment ' was divided into two ( ' enable suction attachment ' and enable ' discharge attachment ' ) , following axiomatic design principles . While creating the initial graph , this was identified as only one function . The ' intercomponent attachment ' is a function that needs to be satisfied at multiple locations in the casing . That is , the function is satisfied by different regions of the casing . Axiomatically , one function is satisfied by one and only one design parameter ; in our case a design solution , which is a section of the casing .

This study 's findings contribute to defining the related and unrelated components of the summarization skills of L2 learners . The second merit is that our findings may help item writers to create more functional distractors . While writing distractors , item writers may unconsciously include the irrelevant features of errors , making the distractors less attractive even for low- proficiency test takers , or tricky for those with high proficiency . Statistical analysis of incorrect options with focal common errors clarifies the types of errors that should be included in distractors , and how frequently selected are such distractors .

"By adding fundamental dimensions , the previously chosen robust product structure is then transferred to a first preliminary design , such as a skeleton model . Referring to the early stages of the product development process , this represents the last milestone of the design process considered in this contribution . The models at this stage are usually used for the definition of interfaces in the concurrent product development or for an initial kinematic simulation . However , they can also be used for a quantitative tolerance analysis , so that the robust parameter design and , if applicable , the tolerance design can be carried out prior to the detail design . To improve the integration into the development process and the usability for the designer , the sampling - based analysis runs CAD internally on the basis of family tables , see 3.5 . The open interface allows the results to be evaluated using established methods such as variance - based sensitivity analysis . This enables not only the creation of a robust product design but also an initial verification of elementary tolerances .

"Based on the large - scale penetration of electric vehicles ( EV ) into the building cluster , a multi-objective optimal strategy considering the coordinated dispatch of EV is proposed , for improving the safe and economical operation problems of distribution network . The system power loss and node voltage excursion can be effectively reduced , by taking measures of time - of - use ( TOU ) price mechanism bonded with the reactive compensation of energy storage devices . Firstly , the coordinate charging / discharging load model for EV has been established , to obtain a narrowed gap between load peak and valley . Next , a multi-objective optimization model of the distribution grid is also defined , and the active power loss and node voltage fluctuation are chosen to be the objective function . For improving the efficiency of optimization process , an advanced genetic algorithm associated with elite preservation policy is used . Finally , reactive compensation capacity supplied by capacitor banks is dynamically determined according to the varying building loads . The proposed strategy is demonstrated on the IEEE 33 - node test case , and the simulation results show that the power supply pressure can be obviously relieved by introducing the coordinated charging / discharging behavior of EV ; in the meantime , via reasonable planning of the compensation capacitor , the remarkably lower active power loss and voltage excursion can be realized , ensuring the safe and economical operation of the distribution system .",the active power loss and node voltage fluctuation,121,129,the varying building loads,171,175,no relation found

"The proof that the relation between subfunctions and functions cannot be formally one of parthood consists of showing that this relation does not meet the three basic mereological postulates 1 - 3 . For this proof , two categories of functions are introduced . The first category consists of token functions / modelled as transformations of tokens of flows , say , flows of energy , material or signals . With a token , flow is meant a specific flow that occurs only once . A token flow of electrical energy a , for instance , is a flow of energy that exists within one specific period in time and at one specific place in space . A second token flow of electrical energy a 0 may be a flow similar to a by having the same intensity and duration as a . But when this second flow a 0 occurs in another period or at another place than a , then a 0 is a token flow different to a . A token function / can now be represented by ordered sets hI , Oi , where I contains the input token flows to the function / and its output token flows . For instance , the token function / = ha , bi transforms the electrical energy token flow a to the rotational energy token flow The token function / 0 = ha 0 , b 0 i , which transforms the electrical energy token flow a 0 to the rotational energy token flow 0 , is then another token function than / = ha , bi as soon as a and a 0 are two different token flows , or b and 0 are two different token flows .",the relation,3,5,energy,64,65,no relation found

"Capital good firms are confronted with very specific challenges and have specific characteristics that make them a unique class of firms . They typically manage programs of projects in which the issue of engineering change cannot be viewed from the perspective of an individual delivery , but at the program level , making engineering change management considerably more difficult compared to one - off projects . This also fundamentally distinguishes this type of firm from those working on a mass production or mass customization basis . In these cases designs are either frozen before entering production or the product has built - in variety parameters . In either case engineering change would be easier to manage , and the effect of engineering change on design and process variety would be limited . The framework of archetypes recognizes that there is no such thing as a typical capital good firm , but that there exist different configurations . We discuss our findings in light of three issues : ( 1 ) generalizability of the framework to the entire capital good sector , ( 2 ) the role of the environment and ( 3 ) the notion of complexity . An important question concerns the generalizability of the archetypes framework to other firms in the capital good sector . Our results apply to a broad class of capital good firms . This class is mainly characterized by the existence of a portfolio of products . Firms having multiple products in a portfolio typically look for ways to reuse design information from one order to the other , and they attempt to do so using as much process standardization as possible .

The LNS design does occupy almost three times the area of the FP unit , but applying a 50 percent reduction as one moves from 65 to 45 nm , it would become 1.5 times the size . The comparison would then have to account for the assumed size of an FP division unit . If this were taken to be , say 25 percent of that of the adder and multiplier , then this LNS design might occupy 1.2 times the area of the FP unit . This improvement to 58 percent of the delay ( or better at 45 nm ) with 1.2 times the area seems roughly consistent with the results observed at 0.18 mm : 70 percent of the delay with equal area .",a reduction,103,105,55 percent,44,46,no relation found

A total of 112 potential outliers across the four categories ( 28 individuals x 4 ) gives an outlier percentage of 14.29 ( 16/112 ) .

"There are abundant research studies on simple cantilever beam models , but there are few on S-shaped folding cantilever with complex structure , although it is widely used . In order to study the deformation failure of S-shaped folding cantilever , the force analysis of S-shaped folding cantilever was carried out in this article , and the stress values of different positions under the external load of the cantilever were deduced . The finite element model about folding cantilever was built based on software ANSYS . The theoretical calculation was compared with the finite element calculation , and the results showed that the max stress is 681 MPa based on the derived theoretical formula , the max stress is 673 MPa based on the ANSYS , the error is 1.18 , which can prove formula is accurate . To further validate the stress predicted by the mathematical modeling , a micro-force testing platform was built to test the cantilever . Since the stress value cannot be measured directly in the test , the force corresponding to the stress was taken as standard and compared it with the simulation . The tested external force was corresponding the yield limit . The results showed that the experimental force was 0.06462 before the plastic deformation occurred , the theoretical outcome was 0.065231 corresponding the yield limit , the error was 0.94 . Both simulation and experimental results depict that the theoretical model is effective for predicting the stress of the folded cantilever .

"While steady - state solutions of backlog and delay have been derived for wireless systems , the analysis of transient phases still poses significant challenges . Considering the majority of short - lived and interactive flows , transient startup effects , as caused by sleep scheduling in cellular networks , have , however , a substantial impact on the performance . To facilitate reasoning about the transient behavior of systems , this paper contributes a notion of non-stationary service curves . Models of systems with sleep scheduling are derived and transient backlogs and delays are analyzed . Further , measurement methods that estimate the service of an unknown system from observations of selected probe traffic are developed . Fundamental limitations of existing measurement methods are explained by the of the transient service and further difficulties are shown to be due to the of network service processes . A novel two - phase probing technique is devised that first determines the shape of a minimal probe and subsequently obtains an accurate estimate of the unknown service .

"The second problem is that many studies do not adjust for cost of living differences when they try to measure inequality . Spatial price differences within China are likely to have grown over time , as markets for private urban housing replaced the previous state provision of housing . In this paper , we develop housing - related spatial deflators for 104 major cities , and we find that spatial inequality in urban China in 2016 is overstated by 27 if nominal GDP per resident data are used instead of spatially deflated data that reflect cost of living differences coming just from the housing market . It is likely that a more comprehensive deflator that also covers a basket of other nontraded services , along with the traded goods that have been studied in the past by the basket approach , would show similar spatial patterns ; future research could usefully combine the two approaches . We lack the data for calculating spatial deflators at the beginning of China 's reform era , but spatial price differences back then should have been smaller , given the widespread public provision of housing at the time . Therefore , the trend rate of decline in regional inequality should be even stronger in real terms than in nominal terms . This positive outcome of falling spatial inequality during China 's reform era should be more widely recognized .",decline,201,202,they,16,17,no relation found
"Approximately 544 million tonnes of fly ash ( FA ) are generated annually worldwide , 80 of which is disposed of in landfills . Thus , using FA as a replacement for cement has turned out to be popular in construction industries around the world because of its strong properties and crucial role in decreasing the volume of pollutants and CO 2 produced by cement production . Meanwhile , the use of Saudi FA ( SFA ) as a suitable supplemental cementing material to partly substitute cement in the design of SFA - based concrete is highly imperative . An extensive experimental study was conducted to utilize increased levels of SFA in the production of concrete . Six concrete mixes were utilized : five out of the six mixes were made with different levels of SFA and one mix was used as a reference . This study presents the findings of using different volumes of SFA with variable proportions ( i.e. , 0 , 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 , and 50 ) . Experimental tests were performed to study the properties of SFA - based concrete , including slump test , air content , setting times , thermal profile , specific gravity , sieve gradation , flexural strength , compressive strength , tensile strength , wear depth , resistance to abrasion , and elasticity modulus , at different time intervals for one year . However , the hardened strength properties and resistance to abrasion exhibited incessant and substantial enhancement at 56 days and up to one year , which is generally attributable to the pozzolanic reaction of SFA . Subsequently , all strengths increased when thermal heat decreased , and test results indicate that SFA can potentially substitute cement in concrete by up to 50 for the fabrication of structural concrete elements in the construction industry .",the world,43,45,different levels,132,134,no relation found

"Graphs were generated for three separate manufacturing options for a pump casing and on a section of an aeroengine structural component . It can be seen that the set composition - based graph creation method , using the manufactured segments to associate generic functions and generic sections , results in too many relationships among functions and sections . When the generic functions were associated with generic sections manually , taking help from the manufactured segments so that an enhanced function means ( EF - ) tree is created , the relationships tended to be less dense . Since the underlying graph structure essentially represents the architecture of the component considered , graphs generated from the two methods ( initial method of associating GFs to GSs through manufactured segments and the morerefined method , where a graph is created from an EF - tree ) were evaluated using measures applicable to the underlying matrices for the graphs . Considerable difference in evaluated measures can be observed for entire products ( pump casing ) and for sections of products ( vane structure in an aero engine static structure ) when generating graphs based on the two methods . The set composition - based graph creation method , while producing different graphs for different manufacturing options , results in indistinguishable graphs for sections of components ( the vane structure ) . This is due to the limited number of functions and sections associated with the vane structure . The EF tree - based graph generation on the other hand involves manual decisions while setting the interactions among different design solutions and generates distinctive graphs for a complete component ( the pump casing ) or a section of a component ( the vane structure ) . Thus the methods considered can be used as a sequence of measures to generate and evaluate information about integrated products . To begin with , the initial GF to GS graph creation method can be used to create an overall idea of the product with different function to section associations . Then , each section can be looked in detail with the EF - tree and analysed separately . This will help designers realise previously hidden information or look in more detail at a particular section or function to section relation ( as demonstrated by the centrality measures discussed in 3.5 ) . For example , the graphs for the two manufacturing method for the vane structure ( 24 , 25 ) appear very similar . Thus the architecture representations based on the two manufacturing options are identical . In such cases , designers can direct their attention at other distinguishing characteristics so that a certain manufacturing split is favoured over the other . In the vane structure case , the radial split causes weld lines to be present in the flow path of the structure while the circumferential split causes discontinuities to be present in load path . Decision about choosing a manufacturing option then becomes weighing the impact on load paths and flow paths due to the selection of a certain manufacturing split . Furthermore , the EF - trees might also enable the designers to build hierarchies into the design such that a certain SVD decay pattern is observed which may indicate the possibility of particular manufacturing split . If the initial function - section association is combined with the creation of detailed EF - trees at early stages of development , it might help designers realise the implications of different manufacturing options on the product 's functional realisation . Therefore , product architecture evaluation based on manufacturability considerations is facilitated .",GS,321,322,an enhanced function,77,80,no relation found
"It is also worth noting that not all of the participants made reference to all three aspects of complex design problems . For example , participant SB9 and participant SR6 did not explicitly discuss the complexity of their design problems and hence did not give any characterisations of complexity . Such gaps can be used to stimulate further questioning when using the framework to identify potential points of overlap and difference between different design contexts : Is the non-mention of these aspects a deliberate omission that indicates an openness to the different possibilities ( e.g. the solution might require both avoiding and exploiting complexity ) or is it that one of the elements is assumed and not explicitly stated ( e.g. it is The number of '' ? '' symbols indicates the number of participants who included the design objective in their description of complex design practice The number of '' ? '' symbols indicates the number of participants who included the design approach in their description of complex design practice assumed that the solution requires the avoidance of complexity , but the participant does not explicitly say this ) ? Moving beyond the two fields studied in this paper , the framework provides a basis for describing other complex design practices without the need to refer to the detailed nature of the system 's entities ( e.g. whether they are biological or robotic ) . Having such domain-neutral descriptions allows one complex design problem and its associated practices to be compared with those from another field , even when this other field deals with systems consisting of very different kinds of entity . This permits those working on the same complex design problem to recognise that they are characterising the problem in different ways , preventing the development of incoherent or poorly coordinated solutions . For example , one designer might be working to optimise an outcome based on the assumption that it is a well - defined requirement , while another designer might be seeking a solution where this outcome is only one of several possibilities which serve as alternatives to deliver some other less well - defined or higher level requirement . Without recognising this discrepancy , the two designers might develop solutions that are inconsistent with each other . At the same time , by allowing design practices to be described in a way that is independent of issues that are tied to a specific domain or context allows points of The left- hand column is the framework for complex design , with a row defined for every distinction for each of the three aspects . The remaining columns represent each participant in both studies . The intersections of the rows and columns in the grid are marked with a '' ? '' to indicate when participants made those distinctions to describe or explain their design practice overlap to be more easily identified and knowledge to be shared . For example , a designer wishing to apply simplifying principles to a particular complex design problem might be able to find techniques for doing this which have been developed by another designer working on a problem in some other design context . Identifying such opportunities for sharing knowledge and highlighting mismatches in practices prevents efforts being duplicated or misaligned when addressing complex design problems .",principles,502,503,the detailed nature,218,221,no relation found
"Whether it concerns a high - level procedural model or a detailed analytical model , for a process modelling initiative to impact beyond a few specialists , the models should be easy to understand and deliver clear benefit . Even if practitioners might in principle derive benefits from models and modelling , in an industry context , there are many pressures competing for time and attention . During product development , modelling and improving processes are often seen as non-critical activities and delivery of the next program often takes priority . Process improvement and its related modelling activities are seen by many design personnel as tasks that can be left for later lifecycle phases , for example for improving production processes when ramping up production . Another issue is that development projects can often seem quite ad - hoc , with much attention devoted to chasing for information and attention , and addressing issues and problems as they emerge . Thus , from a practitioner 's perspective , many DDP models can seem idealised and sterile and not relevant to the day-to - day activities of the design engineers who must participate in developing or implementing them . Due to the difficulties of bringing such personnel on board and the limited available time , modellers may often choose the ' low- hanging fruit ' and focus their efforts on support processes such as engineering change management which have a more repeatable nature and often involve administrative instead of technical issues .",modelling and improving processes,71,75,later lifecycle phases,111,114,Modelling and improving processes are seen by many design personnel as tasks that can be left for later lifecycle phases.

"Cloud service certifications ( CSC ) attempt to assure a high level of security and compliance . However , considering that cloud services are part of an ever-changing environment , multi-year validity periods may put in doubt reliability of such certifications .

CA of cloud services is still in its infancy , thus , we conducted a thorough literature review , interviews , and workshops with practitioners to conceptualize an architecture for continuous cloud service auditing .

"The applied development process and the particular use of certain function models during the conceptual design stage is largely dependent on the specific company and on the disciplines involved . Mechanical engineers were found to be using function models considerably less often than other disciplines . The differences also surface in terms of the level of participation of different disciplines in the generation and application of function models . At the same time , the level of participation on which function models are used seems corresponding to the specific purpose for which they are applied . This can be seen with respect to system - level function models ( level 4 of participation ) : these mainly serve the purpose of supporting the allocation process of requirements and functions to the solution elements / sub- systems foreseen for their implementation . As can be expected , they are then developed involving less disciplines ; that is to say , predominantly those that are responsible for them .",participation,56,57,different disciplines,58,60,The differences surface in terms of the level of participation of different disciplines.
"The most significant feature in Hong Kong was that the Hong Kong assessors considered cases 1 , 2 , and 5 's performances ( i.e. , agreed overall score ) as "" unbenchmarkable "" or "" below the benchmark level , "" as clearly distinct from the IDS developers who did not give an "" unbenchmarkable "" overall score to any of the performances they had observed .

"Coefficient of friction , contact area between shoe and friction disk , shoe thickness , shoe density , shoe elastic modulus , and braking pressure were selected as random variables .

Therefore , the friction coefficient is selected as one of random variables . In the process of brake shoe production , it is difficult to guarantee the complete homogeneity of each brake shoe and the complete consistency of material properties . At the same time , the material properties will fluctuate slightly under the influence of external conditions , so the density and elastic modulus are selected as two random variables .

"Again , speaking on behalf of former colonies and LDCs , China decried colonialism , and , more generally , foreign interference in the internal affairs of any country . Even more importantly , however , China condemned vehemently foreign powers ' disregard for national borders . Naturally , international law had changed in the 20th century to soften China 's understanding of sovereignty . Generally speaking , though , this was the "" Golden Rule "" before 1945 . The end of the Second World War brought about a change in the inviolability of the sovereignty principle to allow space for the protection of ethnic groups in a foreign country and prevent the risk of genocide . In this vein , China viewed with greater acceptance of international involvement in internal problems when ethnic groups were at risk of genocidal crimes . This change about the protection of ethnic groups was fundamental in the development of the principle of "" Responsibility to Protect . "" As a result of this transformation in international law , the importance and sanctity of borders in international relations became secondary to protecting individual human rights . The principle of "" Responsibility to Protect "" was central in the modification of China 's position regarding the implementation of the UN PKMs .",ethnic groups,105,107,borders,45,46,no relation found

"The Qiyas for L1 Arabic language test is a standardized test recently developed by the National Center for Assessment ( NCA ) in Riyadh , Saudi Arabia . The lack of and need for a high - quality measurement tool that produces dependable estimations of the language skills of L1 speakers in the Arab world motivated the NCA to pioneer the development of such a test . The Qiyas for L1 Arabic language test is hypothesized to involve one dominant factor that assesses four skills : reading comprehension , rhetorical expression , structure , and writing accuracy . The test was developed primarily for the purpose of selection , where the intended population is people seeking jobs in schools , public relations , TV , radio stations , or other types of local or international communication that use modern Arabic as the main language . In addition , the test serves as a tool for selecting students for Arabic language programs in universities and / or programs that require higher language skills , like Islamic studies and law , and for diagnostic purposes , including placement of students at an appropriate level in university - level Arabic language programs and course waivers from some Arabic courses . Such language skills are expected to have been acquired by the targeted population throughout their education . The ultimate purpose of the Qiyas for L1 Arabic language test is to serve as a standardized tool that assesses modern standard Arabic language skills , not only in Saudi Arabia but throughout the Arab world .

"In this paper , an incremental conductance algorithm is proposed to track the MPP for a PV module under a fast -changing solar irradiation level . The confusion faced by the conventional algorithm is discussed and modifications are proposed to mitigate the inaccurate response . Compared with the current research status , the control system structure of the proposed algorithm is simpler and more stable , and can accurately respond and track MPP . This improves the stability of the system and avoids misjudgment when the irradiance changes . Simulation results validate that the algorithm is more stable than the traditional algorithm , and improves not only the tracking speed but also the tracking accuracy of the system . The proposed algorithm has a similar structure to the conventional method and no additional hardware components are needed in implementation . It can thus be easily implemented using a low - cost microcontroller , increasing the likelihood of the method being adopted in real PV power generation systems .",Simulation results,89,91,the conventional method,127,130,Simulation results are compared to the conventional method.

For example , if an original equipment manufacturer ( OEM ) has great competency in handling higher degree of integrative complexity ( i.e. , lower modularity ) , they can opt for any decomposition with simpler and balanced modules ( i.e. , lower and equitable module - level complexity ) .

"Although the binary decoder is efficient , there are two main challenges to properly exploit this technique for fault isolation of reconfigurable hardware . The first challenge is the well - known limitation of low coverage from functional testing which can introduce a sampling noise to the binary decoding method leading to misdiagnosis . Hence , a suspiciousness ranking metric that classifies resources according to their existence rate in failed DCs is developed instead of binary decoding methods . Additionally , for > 1 along with the proposed ranking metric are shown to be effective for surmounting the low coverage issue of functional testing as explained in Section 5.2 . Since all DCs implement the same application functionality while utilizing a disjunct set of resources , each DC requires the same resource count . The second challenge is to construct a constrained design matrix for any given and with rows of equal weight dictated by the application size , Available techniques used to construct f-disjunct matrices stipulate a set of conditions on matrix size and the row weights which preclude the flexibility needed to meet design and resource count constraints of operational testing of reconfigurable fabrics .

Although the meetings were initiated for the purpose of information seeking , this process amounted to only 8 of the time compared to knowledge creation between novices and experts ( 47 of meeting time ) , and contextual information sharing ( 45 of meeting time ) . Both experts and novices were found to contribute equally and interactively to the discussion and analysis of solutions . The analysis showed how the processes alternated in the meetings .

"Whether it concerns a high - level procedural model or a detailed analytical model , for a process modelling initiative to impact beyond a few specialists , the models should be easy to understand and deliver clear benefit . Even if practitioners might in principle derive benefits from models and modelling , in an industry context , there are many pressures competing for time and attention . During product development , modelling and improving processes are often seen as non-critical activities and delivery of the next program often takes priority . Process improvement and its related modelling activities are seen by many design personnel as tasks that can be left for later lifecycle phases , for example for improving production processes when ramping up production . Another issue is that development projects can often seem quite ad - hoc , with much attention devoted to chasing for information and attention , and addressing issues and problems as they emerge . Thus , from a practitioner 's perspective , many DDP models can seem idealised and sterile and not relevant to the day-to - day activities of the design engineers who must participate in developing or implementing them . Due to the difficulties of bringing such personnel on board and the limited available time , modellers may often choose the ' low- hanging fruit ' and focus their efforts on support processes such as engineering change management which have a more repeatable nature and often involve administrative instead of technical issues .",it,1,2,a more repeatable nature,238,242,no relation found

"In this paper , we take a step further to study a new problem of persistent traffic volume measurement . After we measure the point traffic volume at a certain location over time for many measurement periods , we naturally want to mine the data for more knowledge . Given a certain number of measurement periods , the point persistent traffic is defined as the set of vehicles that pass the location in all those periods . The rest is treated as transient traffic . For example , we may want to learn the persistent traffic volume over the workdays of a week , over the Saturdays of several weeks , or on all days in a month . Such data tells us the amount of core , stable traffic at a location , as the transient traffic varies over time . Similarly , after measuring the pointto-point traffic volume between two locations for many measurement periods , we want to know the persistent traffic volume containing common vehicles that show up during each period from one location to the other . For example , if a location is consistently congested , we may find the sources of the traffic based on point - to - point traffic measurement . In particular , the persistent point - to - point traffic tells us the minimum amount of traffic contribution that we can always expect from each of those sources . Finally , we generalize the problem to persistent multi-point traffic measurement for the volume of common vehicles that show up at multiple given locations persistently over a number of periods .

Beams with different boundary and load conditions are analyzed and the results are compared with those derived from the differential approach showing that they are different in general . With this integral formulation , the paradox that appears when solving the cantilever beam with the differential form of the Eringen model ( increase in stiffness with the nonlocal parameter ) is solved , which is one of the main contributions of the present work .",Beams,104,105,the Eringen model,72,75,Beams are analyzed by the Eringen model.
"Two aspects of the subtasks for Product 2 were the most problematic for the majority of the participants : increasing the hour setting and accessing the alarm mode . When attempting to increase the hour , the majority of the participants were affected by the implementation of the down image schema . The down feature was used to increase the time while an up feature to decrease it . Participants ' mental model of experience associating an increase with up and decrease to down was violated and though the subtask was completed quickly , many errors were also made . The second aspects of the difficulties experienced by the majority of the participants in Product 2 involve accessing the alarm mode . While trying to enter the alarm mode , the majority of the participants used variations of the statement "" I am looking for how to get into alarm mode "" , which speaks of the difficulty in locating the right button for the . Participants had problems differentiating between the buttons that were similar in labels , which increased their cognitive load of finding the right way to complete the task .",Participants ' mental model,69,73,their cognitive load,181,184,no relation found
"In this paper , a novel theoretical model is developed to investigate the relationship between the uniqueness and of a PUF response . A software simulation demonstrates that the proposed model can accurately estimate either uniqueness or given the other . We have analysed the effect of the number of devices on both uniqueness and in practice . For the ideal case , the larger the number of devices , the closer the can get to the ideal value of 1 , and the closer the uniqueness is to the ideal value of 0.5 . In practice the larger number of devices leads a more accurate estimation as for a given value of uniqueness , the min-entropy value is bounded when calculated over a small number of devices . A hardware experiment based on a RO PUF design is presented to evaluate the proposed model and it is implemented on a large scale testbed of 184 Xilinx Artix -7 FPGA based Basys3 boards . The and uniqueness experimental results are 0.73 and 0.48 , respectively , which match both the theoretical analysis and software simulation . Hence , the proposed model can accurately estimate the trend and the lower bound of the relationship between uniqueness and . Moreover , for the RO PUF , the longer the RO evaluation time , the higher the uniqueness and .",A hardware experiment,129,132,a given value,109,112,no relation found
"I was sitting with Chief Yellowhead of Nibinamik First Nation , also known as Summer Beaver , an Oji-Cree community . He was facing an immense challenge for his community - economic development . Chief Yellowhead is a quiet , strong man with a good heart and kind eyes that demand one 's attention . He listens intently to those around him , and then when he speaks , he is clear and careful in what he says . He was worried for his community as it continues to face ongoing infringements on their inherent rights to govern their traditional territory . His community is within Canada 's Ring of Fire , an area rich in minerals . In 2010 , the Government of Ontario passed the Far North Act ( Government of Ontario , Service Ontario , 2010 ) which provided a legislative framework for development , land use , and protection within the northlands . This essentially legalized plans to develop this area , including a multibillion - dollar chromite mining and refining project that is forecast to generate over 100 billion dollars in the next 20 years . Canada 's largest corporations are looking to extract various resources within this Cree traditional territory . The Chief is worried about the impact on his community . He explained that an existing mine nearby had already begun to pollute one of the rivers . This river is a major source of fish for the community . The community is also reporting increased cases of cancer . Now many large companies are pressuring the community to sign agreements and be a part of "" modern development . "" Chief Yellowhead told me a story of when he was a child and how that story had a profound influence on his life and his leadership and how he is approaching this situation : I was just a boy , no higher than this ( he raised his hand waist high ) . I was playing in our summer camp when several Elders walked into the camp and sat by the fire . Eight of them eventually sat by the fire . One Elder began relating a story about the future and how people would come , the rivers would run red and be poisoned , the trees would die , and the fish and animals would suffer and turn on us .

"This paper proposed a new memory disaggregation system backed by RDMA - supported high bandwidth networks . The proposed hypervisor - based design for disaggregated memory provides memory extension to the remote memory transparently to guest operating systems and applications . Its new design proposed a new replacement scheme , overlapped memory reclaim and network transfer , and scalability supports by per-vCPU data structures and lockless writeback operations . In addition , the elastic block maximizes the performance benefit of exploiting the spatial locality , as it dynamically adapts to changing access patterns . The experimental results showed that the disaggregated memory can provide on average 6 percent performance degradation compared to the ideal local - memory only machine , even though the direct memory capacity is only 50 percent of the total memory footprint . In addition , the proposed design provides scalable performance with increasing numbers of vCPUs . With the advent of high bandwidth non-volatile memory technologies , the proposed disaggregated memory will be able to expand its support for general hierarchical memory systems , such as conventional DRAM and new non-volatile memory . To prove its design flexibility , the paper also showed the preliminary performance evaluation with the new Optane SSD as the indirect memory .",This paper,0,2,per-vCPU data structures,61,64,This paper proposes a new memory disaggregation system using per-vCPU data structures.
"The qualitative scores for the power interconnects are calculated by counting the number of power interconnects in each layer of the 2D/3D chip stack . This is then normalized with respect to the total number of interconnects that is physically possible to be realized in a 3D chip stack . This normalization ensures a fair comparison between designs of different physical sizes . The number of power interconnects for MPUs are counted double that for memory chips . This is to resolve a qualitative difference between the two . It is assumed that the signal interconnects needed between the MPU and the memory chip , and the signal interconnects needed between the 3D stack and devices outside of the package are determined by the bandwidth requirements , and are fixed . These interconnects are counted as a single unit each . The total possible number of interconnects in a 2D/3D chip stack is calculated by assuming that each layer is populated by all possible interconnects , i.e. : 1 ) power interconnects for MPU ( 2 units ) , 2 ) power interconnects for memory ( 1 unit ) , 3 ) signal TSVs ( 1 unit ) , which represent a maximum total of 4 units per layer that carries interconnects . Since in all our configurations , the TC is always facing down , it never contains any TSVs / interconnects in that layer and is not counted . For example , design O1 has one layer of interconnect ( C4 ) , hence , a maximum possible total of 4 units ; designs O2 / O3 have three layers of interconnect ( C4 , BC , C4 ) , hence , a maximum possible total of 12 units , and so on . Similarly , the lower the score , the better the design qualitatively .",These interconnects,131,133,each layer,17,19,These interconnects are counted in each layer of the 2D/3D chip stack.

"A main requirement in the path towards 5G systems is to increase the centralization degree of RAN functionality . Classical technology is deemed unfeasible in many realistic scenarios for 5G and new RAN functional splits have been defined to enable a smoother migration . In this paper we showed that next generation - RAN faces a joint problem to route traffic across fronthaul / backhaul ( crosshaul ) transport networks while maximizing the amount of centralization . To address this issue , we defined a metric to measure the degree of centralization and proposed three algorithms to maximize it while meeting transport constraints : , and . WIZHAUL - BBB provides a near-optimal solution which yields a performance upper bound . - GR and WIZHAUL are greedy heuristics where WIZHAUL - GA achieves the best trade - off between computational load reduction and distance to the optimal solution .

"Previous studies sought to generally classify the frequent spelling errors made by typical students through different learning stages , where errors of spelling the hamzah were listed among others in a rapid and simplified way . Yet , no study has targeted struggling learners , or considered the multi-glossic context of Arabic , or focused exclusively on the middle forms of the hamzah spelling . Examining the spelling performance and error types made by two groups of graduate college students , hearing and deaf , on the specific case of middle hamzah , has the potential of detecting the linguistic skills that may affect their accurate spelling , and shed light on the cognitive and linguistic routes activated in the process . If the stimuli present categories with variable degrees of phoneme-graphene transparency , the level to which spellers rely on the sub-lexical phonological route will be shown . The cases of transparent orthography in which the spelling of hamzah follows the conversion rules of one - to - one would be better spelled than those of one - to - many . In cases of opaque orthography in which some of the hamzah spellings are also initiated , the phonological route may not dominate the spelling process , with the lexical route becoming more activated . If the stimuli also present categories with the type of middle hamzah occurring originally in the word stem or incidentally by inflectional or derivational affixations , the extent to which spellers rely on the lexical route will be detected .",cases,150,151,the level,134,136,no relation found

In other words , the key press features while sitting may differ substantially from the key press features while laying down . One main limitation of our attack framework is that it is not robust against such different body postures and orientation . In order to overcome this , an attacker must train multiple classification models using data corresponding to different user postures and orientations , and then apply the appropriate one for the victim . This , if the attacker knows what was the victim 's posture while typing . Similarly , if the target user is moving ( for example : walking , running , sitting inside a car or train , etc. ) while typing , keystroke events in the accelerometer / gyroscope data may get masked and our framework may not be able to correctly infer them . However , we must point out that this issue is not specific only to our attack framework , but other frameworks in the literature suffer from a similar drawback . Power Consumption . Another limiting factor of our attack can be the power consumption rate on the smartwatch , due to the continuous recording of sensor data at a high frequency . For instance , the 300 m Ah battery inside the Samsung Gear Live dropped from 100 to 69 percent in an hour , while recording linear accelerometer readings at 50 Hz .
